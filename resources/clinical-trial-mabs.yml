  description: |-
    REGN10933 + REGN10987 is a combination of two nonoverlapping mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in phase III trials. The combination has demonstrated preliminary virological efficacy in a phase II trial of outpatients. A phase III trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.

    LY3819253 (LY-CoV555) is a mAb targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which has been shown to reduce virus levels and possibly hospitalizations in a phase II trial. A phase III trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy. It is also being studied in combination with LY-CoV016 which appears to be the same mAb as CB6 and JS016.
