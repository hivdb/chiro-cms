This table lists SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro, or Mpro for Main protease)
inhibitor resistance mutations. The 3CLpro resistance mutations are selected met
one or more of the following criteria:

1. having a ≥2.5-fold reduction in susceptibility to a clinical stage mAb;
2. having been selected in vitro by an mAb; or
3. having been selected in vivo in a patient receiving an mAb or experiencing
   prolonged infection.

A
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#146aa8;color:white;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">dark blue cell</span>
indicates a ≥10-median fold reduction in susceptibility; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#7fcbee;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">light blue cell</span>
indicates a 5-10-median fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#e6f5fc;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">very light cell</span>
cell indicates a 2.5-5-median fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:white;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">white cell</span>
indicates a <2.5-median fold reduction; and a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#f0f0f0;border:1px solid #aaa;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">gray cell</span>
indicates the absence of susceptibility data. Cells with a "P" letter indicates
that the position is in the 3CLpro substrate binding pocket, which are
associated with reduced susceptibility. Bold mutations with a yellow background
represent the consensus for one or more variants of concern or of interest. The
"fitness" column indicate the relative enzyme activity
(K<sub>cat</sub>K<sub>m</sub>) between the mutation and the wild-type,
determined either biochemically or in cell culture — an OK indicates ≥0.8-fold;
a single down arrow (↓) indicates 0.4-0.8-fold; a pair of down arrows (↓↓)
indicates 0.15-0.4-fold; and a triplet of down arrows (↓↓↓) indicates
<0.15-fold. The numbers in the “in patient” column indicate the numbers of times
the mutation was selected in vivo during prolonged infection or in a patient
receiving an mAb. The numbers in the “in vitro” column indicate the number of
times the mutation was reported to be selected during passage in the presence of
an mAb. The proportions in the "prevalence" column show the mutation prevalence
as of June 2022. A CSV/Excel file is available for downloading which includes
the exact values of median folds and relative enzyme activities (fitness).
