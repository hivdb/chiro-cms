This table lists SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro, or Mpro for Main protease)
inhibitor resistance mutations. The 3CLpro resistance mutations shown met one or
more of the following criteria: (1) having a ≥2.5-fold reduction in
susceptibility to a 3CLpro inhibitor; (2) reported to be selected in vitro by a
3CLpro inhibitor in two or more studies; and/or (3) selected in vivo in two or
more patients receiving a 3CLpro inhibitor.

A
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#146aa8;color:white;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">dark blue cell</span>
indicates a median ≥10-fold reduction in susceptibility; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#7fcbee;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">light blue cell</span>
indicates a median 5-10-fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#e6f5fc;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">very light cell</span>
cell indicates a median 2.5-5-fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:white;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">white cell</span>
indicates a median <2.5-fold reduction; and a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#f0f0f0;border:1px solid #aaa;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">gray cell</span>
indicates the absence of susceptibility data.

Cells with a "P" letter indicates that the position is in the 3CLpro substrate
binding pocket. Mutations with a yellow background represent the consensus for
one or more variants of concern or interest.

The "fitness" column indicate the relative enzyme activity
(K<sub>cat</sub>K<sub>m</sub>) between the mutation and the wild-type,
determined either biochemically or in cell culture — an OK indicates ≥0.8-fold;
a single down arrow (↓) indicates 0.4-0.8-fold; a pair of down arrows (↓↓)
indicates 0.15-0.4-fold; and a triplet of down arrows (↓↓↓) indicates
<0.15-fold.

The numbers in the “in patient” column indicate the numbers of times the
mutation was selected in vivo in a patient receiving a 3CLpro inhibitor. The
numbers in the “in vitro” column indicate the number of studies the mutation was
reported to be selected during passage in the presence of a 3CLpro inhibitor.

The proportions in the "prevalence" column show the mutation prevalence reported
by the Kosakovsky Pond laboratory as of June 2022. Proportions ≥ 1/10,000 are
colored in yellow. A CSV/Excel file is available for downloading which includes
the exact values of median folds and relative enzyme activities (fitness).
