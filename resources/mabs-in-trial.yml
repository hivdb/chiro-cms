    population: n=452; diagnosis ≤3 days
    treatment: 0.7g vs 2.8g vs 7g vs placebo
    endpoint: Virological
    finding: Mean VL reduction was similar for all 3 BAM arms at D7 (2.9 logs) and D11 (3.7 logs). At D3 (0.64 logs) and D11 (0.53), the 2800 mg dose alone had a slightly greater VL reduction compared with placebo.
