### Convalescent plasma
Joyner et al published an expanded efficacy analysis of 35,722 hospitalized patients with severe disease in the Expanded Access Program of whom 61% were in the ICU and 33% receiving mechanical ventilation[^10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359]. The 7D mortality was 8.7% [95% CI 8.3%-9.2%] in patients transfused within 3 days of diagnosis but 11.9% [11.4%-12.2%] in patients transfused >=4D (p<0.001). Similar findings observed for 30D mortality (21.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.0001). 7D mortality was also reduced for those who received plasma with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers[^10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359].

### Nucleoside analogs
__AT-527__ is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug of AT-511 which has been studied for the treatment of HCV and has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro[^10.1101/2020.08.11.242834]. It is being evaluated in a phase II placebo controlled trial of hospitalized patients without severe disease.

### DHODH inhibitors
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. DHODH inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. __Leflunomide__ is a licensed drug for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide has been shown to have weak _in vitro_ SARS-CoV-2 activity[^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w]. Leflunomide was shown to reduce virus load and to increase recovery by day 14 in a clinical trial of 27 patients[^10.1101/2020.05.29.20114223]. Several other investigational DHODH inhibitors have exhibited much greater _in vitro_ activity including __PTC299__ which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w][^10.1101/2020.08.05.238394]. PTC299 is an oral drug that is also being developed for oncological indications and has been studied in nine clinical trials in over 300 individuals. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071). __IMU-838__ and __brequinar__ are two other compounds acting by this mechanism. 

### New data on host protease inhibitors
The FDA approved drug, __alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT)__ has also been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2 [^10.1101/2020.05.04.077826]; It is being studied in three clinical trials intravenously and via inhalation.

Camostat mesylate is rapidly converted into its active metabolite GBPA in animals and humans. __FOY-251__, a methanesulfonate of GBPA has been reported to also inhibit TMPRSS2 but at a somewhat reduced capacity compared with camostat[^10.1101/2020.08.05.237651].

### Updated synthesis on chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 
However, two large blinded and three large open-label randomized control trials totaling more than 6,000 patients failed to show any clinical or virological benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine[^10.1101/2020.07.15.20151852][^10.7326/M20-4207][^10.1056/NEJMoa2019014][^10.1101/2020.04.10.20060558][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1009]. Two additional randomized controlled studies totaling more than 3,000 patients failed to show a reduction in the risk of infection among exposed patients receiving HCQ[^10.1101/2020.07.20.20157651][^10.1056/NEJMoa2016638].  The lack of efficacy likely reflects the fact that  at standard dosages, CQ and HCQ do not achieve sufficiently high inhibitory drug levels[^10.1111/j.1365-2125.1989.tb03439.x][^10.2165/00003088-199631040-00003][^10.1128/AAC.00339-08][^10.1002/cpt.1856][^10.1002/cpt.1909] and because cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be dependent primarily on the membrane based enzyme TMPRSS2 rather than on endosomal fusion and acidification[^10.1101/2020.07.22.216150].
