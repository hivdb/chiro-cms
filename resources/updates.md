### Three new repurposed compounds:
__Apilimod__ inhibits the intracellular trafficking of several viruses including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of virus replication. It inhibits a kinase enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) involved in endosomal membrane formation. Although it does not alter the pH of endosomes or inhibit cathepsin B or L, it blocks entry of multiple viruses in pseudovirus and cell culture assays[^10.1101/2020.04.21.053058][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. In two large scale screening assays, it was found to be one of the most inhibitory compounds with EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 10 to 90 nanomolar[^10.1038/s41586-020-2577-1][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.034]. It is an investigational compound that has been studied in human clinical trials as an anticancer agent and is now being studied in a phase II trial for the treatment of COVID-19.

__DHODH inhibitors__: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. DHODH inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. Leflunomide is a licensed drug for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide has been shown to have weak _in vitro_ SARS-CoV-2 activity[^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w]. However, several other investigational DHODH inhibitors have exhibited much greater _in vitro_ activity including __PTC299__ which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w][^10.1101/2020.08.05.238394]. PTC299 is an oral drug that is also being developed for oncological indications and has been studied in nine clinical trials in over 300 individuals. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071).

__Host protease inhibitors__: In addition to camostat and nafamostat, the FDA approved drug, __alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT)__ has also been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2 [^10.1101/2020.05.04.077826]; It is being studied in three clinical trials intravenously and via inhalation.
