## Polymerase Inhibitors
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. RdRps are highly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families [^10.3390/v11080745]. Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors are the most common antiviral compounds making up a plurality of all licensed antivirals. Most antiviral polymerase inhibitors lack a 3’-hydroxyl group and act as nucleoside analog chain terminators. Others contain a 3'-hydroxyl group yet still result in immediate or delayed chain termination. Finally, some nucleoside analogs become incorporated into viral genomes and inhibit replication by introducing mutations during subsequent rounds of virus replication.

Coronavirus RNA polymerization is more complex than that of other viruses. First, coronaviruses contain a 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN; nsp14) which is required for replication fidelity [^10.1073/pnas.0508200103]. ExoN is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of coronavirus species to ribavirin and several other nucleoside analogs [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1003565][^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. Second, coronavirus genomes are three times larger than most other RNA genomes and thus require increased processivity which may explain the RdRp (nsp12) requirement for two accessory proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). Third, the coronavirus RdRp is required for transcribing multiple sub-genomic mRNAs in addition to copying the full virus genome. Several cryo-EM structures of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 replication-transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2 have been published [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.034][^10.1126/science.abb7498][^10.1038/s41586-020-2368-8][^10.1126/science.abc1560].

### Remdesivir
Remdesivir (GS-5734, Veklury) is the monophosphate prodrug of the parent 1’-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analogue GS-441524 [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01594]. The presence of the phosphate group allows for more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active nucleoside triphosphate form bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step. Remdesivir is a non-obligate chain terminator in that it contains a 3’-OH group. It causes delayed chain termination due to a steric clash with S861 after the addition of three trailing nucleosides [^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056][^10.1074/jbc.RA120.013679][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.015720][^10.1038/s41467-020-20542-0][^10.1016/j.molcel.2021.01.035]. The fact that chain termination does not occur until additional nucleoside triphosphates have been added explains the mechanism by which remdesivir eludes the coronavirus exonuclease.

Remdesivir has broad spectrum activity against multiple RNA viruses and inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>s) generally below 1 μM [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883][^10.1128/mBio.00221-18][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940]. It inhibits coronaviruses in multiple cell types including primary human airway epithelial cells and demonstrates a low potential for off-target toxicity in a variety of cellular and biochemical assays [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1128/AAC.02237-20]. Remdesivir reduces lung virus levels and lung damage in mice infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], and mice and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1038/s41586-020-2423-5]. Remdesivir resistance has been selected in a related coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), during prolonged in vitro passage experiments [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18]. The remdesivir-resistant mutations are in the RdRp fingers domain. Introducing the homologous substitutions into SARS-CoV (F480L + V557L) resulted in a virus with reduced replication and about 6-fold reduced remdesivir susceptibility [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18].

Remdesivir is administered intravenously with a loading dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Following intravenous administration, the achievable maximum remdesivir plasma concentration is predicted to be at least twice as high as its most commonly reported EC<sub>50</sub>s. However, several research groups have argued that remdesivir penetrates poorly into the lungs and that either GS-441524 itself or other GS-441524 prodrugs may be superior to remdesivir [^10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173634][^10.1208/s12248-020-00459-8][^10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00316][^10.1101/2021.02.04.429674][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01929].


As of February 2021, there have been four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir containing a placebo arm [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9][^10.1001/jama.2020.16349] of which two were blinded [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. The NIH Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) led to remdesivir’s FDA Emergency Use Authorization and subsequent approval [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. It randomized 1063 persons with severe disease to remdesivir for 10 days versus placebo. Persons receiving remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days vs 15 days for the placebo group (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12-1.49; p<0.001). Kaplan Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% vs. 15.2% at day 29 (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.52-1.03). A subgroup analysis showed that response to therapy was greater in those with less severe disease (i.e., those not requiring supplemental oxygen or receiving oxygen via nasal cannula) than in those with severe disease (i.e., those requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation).


However, the open-label WHO Solidarity RCT which included 2750 persons randomized to remdesivir and 4800 to standard-of-care detected no reduction in mortality, requirement for ventilation, or reduction in hospital stay for those receiving remdesivir [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184]. In addition, remdesivir was not associated with reductions in either upper or lower respiratory tract virus load levels in the one study that examined this outcome [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. The fourth RCT compared the remdesivir for 10 days vs. 5 days vs. placebo in persons with moderate disease detected no difference between each of the three arms [^10.1001/jama.2020.16349].

### MK-4482 (Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801)
β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a cytidine analogue that exerts its activity primarily through viral mutagenesis. It incorporates into new RNA strands which results in the introduction of large numbers of mutations errors during subsequent rounds of replication [^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (MK-4482 previously known as EIDD-2801) is an orally available NHC prodrug. The fact that MK-4482 is not a chain terminator likely explains the mechanism by which it eludes the proof-reading function of coronavirus exonucleases. Deep sequencing studies have confirmed that viral mutagenesis is the main mechanism by which MK-4482 inhibits coronaviruses [^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].

MK-4482 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1 μM [^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. It has activity in primary human airway epithelial cells. It reduces virus levels, disease, and lung damage in mouse models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883][^10.1038/s41586-021-03312-w] and in ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1038/s41564-020-00835-2]. A phase I dose-ranging study of a 5-day course of oral therapy in healthy adults found no evidence of toxicity compared with a placebo group and detected levels that were expected to be efficacious based on animal model studies (NCT04392219) [^10.1101/2020.12.10.20235747]. A phase II trial examined virological endpoints among persons receiving MK-4482 200 mg BID, 400 mg BID, 800 mg BID versus placebo in 176 nonhospitalized patients with fever and/or signs of a respiratory illness (NCT04405570). Among 78 patients with positive baseline cultures, 6/25 (24%) placebo patients versus 0/47 pooled MK-4482 patients (p=0.001) had positive cultures at day 5 [^10.1038/s41586-021-03312-w]. Two large phase II/III trials in hospitalized (NCT04575584) and nonhospitalized (NCT04575597) patients began in October 2020. MK-4482 is not being studied in pregnant women or women who might become pregnant because mutagenicity has been observed in bacterial studies [^10.1128/AAC.01652-20].

### Other Nucleoside Analogs
Although ribavirin 5’-monophosphate can be incorporated during RNA synthesis, it is readily excised by the coronavirus exonuclease [^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. As a result ribavirin has little, if any, in vitro or in vivo activity against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.virol.2009.09.023][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343][^10.1038/srep01686].

Favipiravir (T-705) is a purine analog prodrug that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form the active metabolite ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (aka T-705-RTP). It has broad spectrum activity against multiple viral RNA polymerases and appears to act by causing viral mutagenesis [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.015][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.03.003][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1002/cpt.1844]. However, it demonstrates little inhibitory activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 60 to >100 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7] consistent with its low rate of favipiravir-RTP incorporation into the RdRp catalytic site [^10.1073/pnas.2021946118]. It displays activity in a hamster model but only when used at high doses [^10.1073/pnas.2014441117].  Several small open-label randomized studies have demonstrated little or no clinical or virological benefit associated with its use [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.142][^10.1128/AAC.01897-20][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1176][^10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105631].

The FDA-approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog sofosbuvir is being studied in several COVID-19 clinical trials. Although it has reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical studies [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104857][^10.1038/s41598-020-73641-9][^10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00392], it has demonstrated little or no inhibitory activity in cell culture [^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411]. One patient-level meta-analysis of three open-label studies totaling 176 patients reported that clinical recovery within 14 days was significantly greater among patients receiving sofosbuvir plus daclastavir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor) than among those receiving standard of care [^10.1093/jac/dkaa418]. If this preliminary finding is validated, it is likely that the response is due to daclastavir because this drug actually has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, although the mechanism for this activity is not known [^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411].

AT-527 is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug of AT-511, previously studied for the treatment of HCV, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with EC90 of about 0.5 M in human airway epithelial cells [^10.1371/journal.pone.0227104][^10.1128/AAC.01201-19][^10.1128/AAC.02479-20]. The mechanism by which it retains activity despite coronavirus exonuclease activity has not been reported. AT-527 is being evaluated in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease.

## Protease Inhibitors
Coronaviruses contain two protease enzymes: 3 chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro or Main \[M\]pro; non-structural protein 5 \[nsp5\]) and papain-like serine protease (PLpro; nsp3). Mpro cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at 11 sites. It is conserved among several families of RNA viruses and has similar cleavage site specificity to the picornavirus family of 3C proteases. Mpro contains 306 amino acids and functions as a homodimer. It shares 96% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV Mpro. PLpro is part of a 1,922 amino acid multidomain transmembrane protein. It cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 boundaries and several host proteins important for innate immunity such as ubiquitin interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG-15).

There are more candidate Mpro inhibitors than PLpro inhibitors because of this enzyme’s similarities to those of other virus species and because 3CLpro is smaller, less complicated, and better able to be produced in large quantities [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140]. There have been more than 100 published Mpro structures but just a few PLpro structures [^10.1016/j.drudis.2020.12.005][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140][^10.1038/s41467-021-21060-3][^10.15252/embj.2020106275]. Although HIV-1 protease inhibitors were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, they have possessed either little or no anti-coronavirus activity in biochemical and cell culture studies [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1128/AAC.00825-20][^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.085], animal models [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1128/mBio.01114-20], and clinical trials [^10.1056/NEJMoa2001282][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1056/NEJMoa2015294].

There have been many drug screens and structure-based designs targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that have identified compounds inhibiting SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 biochemically and in cell culture 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 μM. These compounds belong to several series of reversible and covalently binding irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitors, many of which have been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [^10.1126/science.abb3405][^10.1126/science.abb4489][^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y][^10.3390/v13020174][^10.1128/mBio.01833-20][^10.1038/s41467-021-20900-6][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01063][^10.1016/j.str.2020.10.007]. These compounds are of interest as chemical scaffolds for potential therapeutic agents. However, PI development faces several challenges. First, several compounds may not be sufficiently selective for Mpro, which increases their risk of off-target effects. Indeed, several of these compounds also inhibit endosomal cysteine cathepsins, which are particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro but less important in vivo [^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00815][^10.1101/2021.02.14.431129]. Second, most current inhibitors bind Mpro covalently. Although these are more readily identifiable, covalently binding inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of toxicity [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140].

PF-00835231 is the most potent investigational Mpro inhibitor. It has an IC50 in enzymatic assays of 0.0003 μM and an EC<sub>50</sub> in cell culture of 0.2 μM [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01063][^10.1128/JVI.01819-20]. It has undergone safety studies and pharmacokinetic profiling in rats, dogs, and monkeys [^10.1101/2020.09.12.293498]. PF-07304814 is an intravenously administered phosphate PF-00835231 prodrug which is being studied in a phase I trial of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease (NCT04535167).

Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that has been studied for the treatment of a variety of illnesses. It was found to inhibit Mpro in a high-throughput drug screen and to have inhibitory activity in biochemical and cell culture assays of about 1 μM [^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y]. It appears to inhibit Mpro allosterically [^10.1126/sciadv.abd0345] and to also inhibit PLpro [^10.1101/2020.08.30.273979][^10.1038/s41598-021-83229-6]. It is being studied as an oral drug in two small phase II placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and severe disease.

GC376 has been effectively used for treating cats with the rapidly fatal coronavirus disease FIPV [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1005531]. It forms covalent bonds with the Mpro active site cysteine and inhibits multiple coronaviruses [^10.1128/JVI.01348-12]. Its SARS-CoV-2 Mpro IC50 ranges from 0.03 to 1.5 μM while its cell culture EC<sub>50</sub> ranges from 0.2 to 3.4 μM (Ma et al. 2020; Vuong et [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-18096-2][^10.1101/2020.06.07.138677][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x]al. 2020; Luan et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2020). GC376 is considered a promising lead compound for further development [^10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.004][^10.1101/2020.08.03.235291][^10.1126/sciadv.abe0751].

The approved HCV protease inhibitor boceprevir displays inhibits Mpro biochemically and in cell culture and is also considered a promising lead compound [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00521][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x][^10.1126/science.abf1611][^10.1016/j.str.2020.10.007]

## Entry Inhibitors
The spike glycoprotein is responsible for attachment to host cells and for fusion of viral and cellular membranes. It is a trimer comprising three identical subunits. Each monomer has an exposed S1 attachment domain and a partially hidden S2 fusion domain. Part of S1, the receptor binding domain (RBD), alternates between a closed/down position and an open/up position enabling it to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1126/science.abb2507]. S1 binding occurs on the outer surface of ACE2 whereas angiotensin substrates bind in a deep cleft containing the active site [^10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045][^10.1038/s41586-020-2179-y][^10.1101/2020.06.30.177097]. RBD-ACE2 binding results in structural changes that lead to S1 dissolution, S2 exposure, and virus-cell fusion.

The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is required for the virus spike to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. The spike protein has two cleavage sites including one at the S1/S2 boundary and one within S2 referred to as S2’. The sequences of coronavirus spike cleavage sites, the host enzymes required for their cleavage, and the cellular locations where cleavage occurs influence cell tropism and transmissibility [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. For SARS-CoV-2, the S1/S2 cleavage site is a polybasic furin site that appears to be post-translationally cleaved during viral biosynthesis [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104742][^10.1038/s41586-020-2772-0][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108254][^10.1038/s41586-021-03237-4][^10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.022]. Cleavage of S2 at the S2’ site is by the host protease cathepsin B/L within endosomes and by TMPRSS2 at the plasma membrane. Accumulating data suggest that TMPRSS2-mediated S2’ cleavage is more important for SARS-CoV-2 whereas endosomal cathepsins may have been relatively more important for SARS-CoV-1 [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1073/pnas.0505577102].

S2 contains a fusion peptide, two complementary heptad repeat (HR) regions, designated HR1 and HR2, which are alpha helices with repeated patterns of seven amino acids. HR1 and HR2 are complementary allowing them to bind to associate with each other. After RBD-ACE2 binding, the fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The three HR1 domains then associate with the three HR2 domains to create a six-helix bundle which creates a hairpin effect brining the viral and host cell membranes together [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792][^10.1007/s13238-020-00806-7].

This section describes interventions that interfere with virus entry including neutralizing mAbs, convalescent plasma and polyclonal Ab preparations, fusion inhibitors, ACE2-mimicking compounds, and compounds that inhibit the host proteins required for spike protein cleavage.

### Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
Neutralizing mAbs are effective at preventing or treating multiple viral infections including those caused by respiratory syncytial virus [^10.1038/s41579-019-0149-x][^10.1016/j.prrv.2018.12.001], influenza [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104562], Ebola virus [^10.1056/NEJMoa1910993], and MERS-CoV [^10.1093/infdis/jiab036]. The presence of neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD have correlated with protection in animal models and in previously infected and vaccinated persons, although cellular immune responses and potentially non-neutralizing Abs are likely to have contributed to protection in these studies [^10.1126/science.abc4776][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035389][^10.1056/NEJMoa2034577][^10.1056/NEJMoa2027906][^10.1038/s41586-020-2814-7][^10.1016/j.immuni.2020.07.020][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.015][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002]. Paradoxically, the highest levels of neutralizing Abs levels are detected in patients experiencing severe illness [^10.1038/s41591-020-0897-1][^10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9][^10.1371/journal.pone.0236905][^10.1093/cid/ciaa344], suggesting that they may play a protective role in patients for whom more rapid immunologic responses to infection fail to prevent severe disease [^10.1038/s41577-020-0359-5][^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1101/2020.12.18.20248331]. The most common neutralizing Abs emerging in patients target the S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) [^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1126/sciimmunol.abc8413][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.037][^10.1101/2020.08.21.261727].

Neutralizing mAbs have been isolated most commonly from the memory B cells of persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2, from immunized transgenic mice, and from combinatorial protein display libraries (https://covdb.stanford.edu/page/mab-tables/) [^10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa739]. Regardless of their source, Ab-producing cells are screened for their ability to bind either the S trimer or just the RBD. The most potent SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have IC<sub>50</sub>s between 1 to 15 ng/ml. As standard mAbs have a molecular weight of 150 kDa, an IC<sub>50</sub> below 150 ng/ml indicates picomolar activity.

Although no two mAbs share identical epitopes, those binding the RBD are usually classified according to where on the RBD that they bind. Two main classes of mAbs bind the ACE2-binding region of the RBD referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM) and two classes bind a separate part of the RBD referred to as the RBD core [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.012][^10.1038/s41586-020-2852-1][^10.3390/v13010134]. The RBD core is more evolutionarily conserved than the ACE2-binding residues in the RBM. mAbs that bind this region can often neutralize SARS-CoV and other SARS-related coronaviruses [^10.1038/s41467-020-16256-y][^10.1126/science.abb7269][^10.1038/s41594-020-0480-y][^10.1126/science.abc7424][^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. However, non-ACE2-competing are usually somewhat less inhibitory than ACE2-competing mAbs. Several laboratories have described potent mAbs that recognize the S1 N-terminal domain rather than the RBD [^10.1126/science.abc6952][^10.1038/s41586-020-2571-7]. In macaques, hamsters, and various mouse models, the administration of neutralizing mAbs shortly before or after infection has consistently resulted in reduced respiratory tract virus levels and signs of illness. Table 1 summarizes the pre-clinical data for the mAbs furthest along in their development.

Seven mAb preparations are in phase III trials. Three of these are mAb combinations including casirivimab (REGN10933) / imdevimab (REGN10987) [^10.1126/science.abd0827][^10.1126/science.abe2402][^10.1126/science.abd0831],  bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) / etesevimab (LY-CoV016) [^10.1101/2020.09.30.318972][^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y], and cilgavimab (COV2-2130) / tixagevimab (COV2-2196) [^10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6]. Four are single mAb agents including bamlanivimab monotherapy, sotrovimab (VIR-7831) [^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y], regdanvimab (CT-P59) [^10.1038/s41467-020-20602-5], and TY027 (Table 1). More than 10 additional mAb preparations are in phase I/II trials ( [^10.1093/abt/tbaa020][^10.1080/19420862.2020.1854149]. Three mAb preparations have received FDA EUAs including bamlanivimab monotherapy, bamlanivimab/etesevimab, and casirivimab/imdevimab for use in non-hospitalized patients.

There are currently three mAb preparations for which clinical results are available including monotherapy data for bamlanivimab [^10.1056/NEJMoa2029849][^10.1056/NEJMoa2033130], combination therapy for casirivimab/imdevimab [^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002], and combination therapy for bamlanivimab/etesevimab [^10.1001/jama.2021.0202]. There have also been an additional five press releases announcing preliminary data from studies of these three mAb preparations (Table 2). Based on the combination of data from published trials and top-line results announced as press releases, several conclusions can be drawn with respect to the use of these three mAb preparations for the treatment of non-hospitalized and the prevention of infection in persons with high-risk exposures. Both bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab appear to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in non-hospitalized persons. Both bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab reduce the risk of symptomatic and/or overall infection in persons at high risk of infection. Bamlanivimab was studied in nursing home residents and staff while casirivimab/imdevimab was studied in household contacts of infected persons. The study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized patients was terminated prematurely as an interim analysis pointed to the unlikelihood of achieving benefit. In contrast, the study of casirivimab/imdevimab in hospitalized patients on low-flow oxygen was allowed to continue as this combination demonstrated significant virological benefit in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients.

Each of the three mAb preparations with an FDA EUA are active in vitro against the most commonly circulating variant of concern B.1.1.7 which contains the RBD mutation N501Y. However, both bamlanivimab and the bamlanivimab/etesevimab combination are inactive in vitro against the other two variants of concern – B.1.351 and P.1 – which contain N501Y in combination with E484K and K417N/T. In contrast, imdevimab retains activity against these two variants. Bamlanivimab (but not etesevimab) is also inactive against the widely circulating U.S. variant which contains L452R. Like casirivimab/imdevimab, the combination of cilgavimab/tixagevimab appears to retain activity against each of the three variants of concern. Sotrovimab is active against all three variants of concern; however, its maximal percent inhibition of B.1.1.7 appears to be below 90% [^10.1101/2021.01.27.428516][^10.1101/2021.03.09.434607]. There are no published data on the activity of CT-P59 against variants containing RBD mutations.

### Single domain antibodies (sdAbs)
Single-domain Abs (sdAbs) are heavy chain only antibodies that occur naturally in camelids, which are increasingly being  developed as potential therapeutics [^10.3389/fimmu.2017.01802][^10.1016/j.tim.2020.12.006]. They are identified by screening protein display libraries created from the B cells of immunized or non-immunized camelids as well as from synthetic variable heavy chain libraries [^10.1016/j.tim.2020.12.006]. sdAbs are easier to manufacture than standard mAbs because they can be expressed in bacterial or yeast cells. They can also often be delivered by inhalation. Although they are generally less potent than complete mAbs, their activity can be increased when engineered in multimeric forms. Many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing sdAbs have been isolated [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.031][^10.1126/science.abe3255][^10.1038/s41467-020-19204-y][^10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5][^10.1038/s41589-020-00679-1][^10.1126/science.abe4747][^10.1038/s41594-020-0469-6][^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.023][^10.1073/pnas.2010197117][^10.1126/science.abe6230]. Several sdAbs have demonstrated efficacy in animal models [^10.1073/pnas.2010197117][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.007]but none are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial.

### Convalescent plasma and polyclonal antibody preparations
There has been one large observational trial and several open label and placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma. In the subset of patients in the observational trial that received units with known anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (n=3082), mortality was inversely proportional to antibody titer: 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group. The benefit of high titer convalescent plasma, however, was observed only among those not receiving mechanical ventilation. Among the randomized controlled trials, there was generally no benefit associated with convalescent plasma [^10.1056/NEJMoa2031304] with the exception of one trial in which high-risk patients older than 75 were treated within 72 hours of mild COVID-19 symptoms [^10.1056/NEJMoa2033700]. In this trial, the risk of progression to severe disease was reduced in those receiving convalescent plasma: 13 of 80 (16%) versus 25 of 80 (31%); relative risk = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.94; p=0.03).

Several clinical trials are currently evaluating polyclonal antibody preparations. The largest clinical trials are evaluating antibodies recovered from convalescent patients (NCT04546581) and those isolated from equine hyperimmune sera (INM005; NCT04494984) and genetically modified swine (XAV-19; NCT04453384) [^10.1002/eji.202049072]. Polyclonal antibody preparations are expected to be less expensive than mAb preparations, although they will have a lower mean binding affinity [^10.3390/life11020144].

### Fusion inhibitors
Peptides that mimic HR2 can block virus-cell fusion by preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2. Several peptide mimics of coronavirus HR2 have been shown to potently inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.046][^10.1093/infdis/jiv325][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792][^10.1038/ncomms4067][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00890][^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580][^10.1128/JVI.00635-20]. Interest in coronavirus fusion inhibitors is partly motivated by the high level of S2 conservation. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S2 differ about 10% of their amino acids. However, their HR1 domains differ by 7% and their HR2 domains are essentially identical [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x].

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an HR2-mimicking peptide, EK1, was identified as a potential broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor as it inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at sub-micromolar levels and was safe and protective against MERS-CoV when administered intranasally to mice [^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580]. Based on SARS-CoV-2 structural studies, several EK1 amino acid modifications were made and a cholesterol group was added [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x] because lipidation has been shown to improve the pharmacokinetics and inhibitory activity of viral fusion inhibitors [^10.1128/JVI.00288-17]. This new lipopeptide, named EK1C4 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 fusion about 150 times more potently than EK1, resulting in an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.04 μM.

Several additional highly potent HR2-mimicking SARS-Cov-2 fusion inhibitors have been described including IPB02 and IPB04 [^10.1128/JVI.00635-20], HRC-lipoprotein-SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/mBio.01935-20], and the dimeric lipoprotein \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol [^10.1101/2020.11.04.361154]. Intranasal administration of \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol to ferrets completely protected them from infection while co-housed with other infected ferrets [^10.1126/science.abf4896]. However, there are currently no clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.

### Soluble ACE2 and other molecular decoys
The approximately 750 amino acid soluble recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is safe in human subjects [^10.1007/s40262-013-0072-7] and protects lungs from injury during the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^10.1007/s00018-007-6228-6][^10.1038/nm1267][^10.1186/s13054-017-1823-x][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004]. Even prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rhACE2 was being developed as an ARDS treatment. rhACE2 inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.114][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045] and also appears to prevent the loss of lung protective effects that is associated with the internalization of ACE2 following SARS-CoV-2 binding. Although ACE2 mimics cannot recruit immune cells, they can be potentially bind to SARS-CoV-2 as tightly as mAbs and can be easier to manufacture as they do not require expression in mammalian cells.

Several research groups have shown that rhACE2 and proteins designed to mimic the ACE2 ectodomain are highly potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in cell culture and in pseudovirus entry experiments. Several strategies have been employed to create ACE2 mimics more potent and/or smaller than the natural ACE2 ectodomain by identifying just those ACE2 regions that contribute most strongly to RBD binding [^10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.029][^10.1126/science.abe0075][^10.1126/science.abd9909][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117]. ACE2 mimics have also been fused to Ig Fc domains and to scaffolds to create bivalent or trivalent inhibitors [^10.1038/s41467-020-16048-4][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117][^10.1038/s41594-020-00549-3][^10.1126/sciadv.abf1738][^10.1126/science.abc0870]. Modified ACE2-mimics have been designed that bind in vitro to a high proportion of SARS-related coronavirus spike proteins and might be expected to bind to currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants [^10.1126/sciadv.abf1738]. CTC-445.2d is a dimeric ACE2 mimic that has been shown to protect hamsters from weight loss and death [^10.1126/science.abe0075].

APN1 (Apeiron Biologics), a clinical grade soluble rhACE2 [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004] that has demonstrated safety in 89 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients and volunteers and is now being evaluated in a 200-person placebo-controlled study of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients (NCT04335136). A press release from Apeiron Biologics announced that preliminary data from this trial showed that persons receiving APN1 had reductions in virus load and required mechanical ventilation for fewer days than those receiving placebo (Apeiron Biologics 2021).

### Glycosaminoglycan attachment inhibitors
Glycosaminoglycans are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells and serve as attachment sites for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses [^10.1371/journal.pone.0023710][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.033][^10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106118]. Several compounds that inhibit the interaction between gylcosaminoglycans and viruses have antiviral activity including lactoferrin and the anticoagulants heparin and enoxaparin [^10.1080/22221751.2021.1888660][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.033][^10.1128/JVI.01987-20][^10.1055/s-0040-1721319][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104873]. Administration of heparin intranasally has been proposed as a method of preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 after initial infection without increasing the risk of bleeding [^10.1128/JVI.01987-20]. Heparin and enoxaparin are being studied in clinical trials as both anticoagulants and potential attachment inhibitors. \[CHECK CLINICAL TRIALS\]

## Interferons
In response to cellular changes suggestive of a viral infection, interferons (IFNs) induce numerous IFN-stimulated genes encoding proteins that inhibit viral replication by slowing cellular metabolism, interfering with membrane formation required for virus replication, and inducing cytokines that promote adaptive immunity [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104791]. Although there are three IFN families [^10.1038/nri3787], innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids leads to production of type I and type III (32464097) IFNs. Type I IFNs includes 13 related IFN-α subtypes, IFN-β, and several poorly defined single gene products including IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω. Type III IFN consists of IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3. Although both type I and type III IFNs activate the same dominant JAK-STAT signaling pathway, their cognate receptor expression differs; receptors for type I IFN have near ubiquitous expression throughout the mammalian host, whereas type III IFN receptors are largely thought to be confined to tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [^10.1016/j.immuni.2019.03.025].

Several IFN-α preparations have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus, and several malignancies. IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, congenital immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease, and hepatitis delta infection, respectively. Commercial IFN-α preparations vary in the extent to which they include different IFN-α subtypes, although the biological and clinical significance of the differences between these preparations are not known [^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. Pegylated interferons have a longer half-life because the attached polyethylene glycol delays IFN clearance.

The importance of IFNs for combatting SARS-CoV-2 is underscored by the fact that many viruses, particularly coronaviruses encode multiple proteins that antagonize cellular IFN signaling pathways [^10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81][^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to encode about 10 proteins that allow virus to escape or counteract IFN induction or antiviral action [^10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1008737]. Supporting a role for IFNs in protection against SARS-CoV-2 is the finding that about 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 have neutralizing type I IFN autoantibodies [^10.1126/science.abd4585]. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a reduced IFN response in some studies [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.026][^10.1126/science.abc6027] and an increased response in other studies [^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.017]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to increase ACE2 expression in upper airway cells [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.035].

IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ each demonstrate inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations (100 to 1000 IU/ml) in Vero and Calu3 cell lines and in primary human alveolar cells [^10.1128/JVI.01410-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013788][^10.1128/JVI.00985-20][^10.1128/mBio.01928-20]. Two _in vitro_ studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to Type I IFNs than SARS-CoV possibly because of a deletion in ORF3b, a 154 amino acid protein known to antagonize one of the proteins involved in the IFN response [^10.1128/JVI.01410-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013788][^10.1128/JVI.00985-20][^10.1128/mBio.01928-20]. IFN-α and IFN-β have demonstrated protective effects against SARS and MERS in mice [^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.11.007] and macaques [^10.1038/nm1001][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1000756][^10.1038/srep01686] models while IFN-λ has demonstrated protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 in one mouse model [^10.1038/s41586-020-2708-8]. However, several studies have reported worse outcomes in mouse models of SARS and MERS with delayed administration of type I IFNs [^10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.007][^10.1172/JCI126363][^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6].

There has been one phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial of a nebulized IFN-β preparation SNG001 in non-ventilated hospitalized patients receiving supplementary oxygen [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7], two phase II randomized placebo-controlled trials of subcutaneous IFN-λ in outpatients with mild disease [^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161][^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098], two randomized open-label trials of IFN-β including the SOLIDARITY trial [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1128/AAC.01061-20], one open-label trial of IFN-α [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.053], and one open-label trial of IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4]. Nebulized IFN-β was found to be associated with an improved outcome as 6 of 48 patients in the IFN group vs. 11 of 51 patients in the placebo group developed severe disease or died [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7]. The larger of two Phase II IFN-λ studies showed no virological benefit in outpatients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection [^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161], whereas the smaller study reported lower virus loads at day 7 in a post-hoc adjusted analysis [^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161][^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098]. Among the open-label trials, the strongest signal of efficacy was a shorter time to viral clearance and more rapid clinical improvement in patients receiving IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4].

There is currently one ongoing phase III trial for inhaled SNG001 (IFN-β; EUCTR2020-004743-83-GB) and one planned study for inhaled Novaferon (IFN-α) in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (NCT04669015). Subcutaneous IFN-λ is being studied in a third phase II trial of outpatients (NCT04344600). The NIH treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of IFNs for the treatment of severely ill patients with COVID-19 but provide no recommendation for the use of IFNs in earlier disease.

## Host-Targeting Compounds
Repurposed drugs that have been approved or are being studied for other indications often target host processes that influence viral replication. Such compounds host-targeting compounds may be able to inhibit multiple viruses, since different viruses often depend on similar host factors and pathways. Although such compounds may have a higher risk of toxicity than those specifically targeting a virus protein, such toxicity may be acceptable for the relatively short time required to treat an acute infection. Many host-targeting compounds have that inhibit coronaviruses in vitro have been identified. They may act by inhibiting a cellular protein, influencing a signaling pathway, or modifying a cellular organelle. However, for many inhibitory compounds, the mechanism of action is not known. This section reviews compounds that appear to act primarily by influencing the host rather than the virus and that have favorable safety profiles. They are classified here into compounds that inhibit host proteases required for spike protein cleavage and those that act by other mechanisms.

### Host protease inhibitors
The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is required for the virus spike to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. These proteases include cell surface proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and other related transmembrane serine proteases; furin; and endosomal cathepsins [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. Accumulating data suggest that furin and TMPRSS2 mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2’ sites, respectively [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786]. Endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B and L appear to be less important for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV [^10.1073/pnas.0505577102][^10.1128/JVI.00094-12][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]

Camostat and nafamostat are serine protease inhibitors used in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. They inhibit TMPRSS2 in biochemical assays and coronaviruses in cell culture [^10.1101/2020.08.05.237651][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. In Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells, camostat inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s generally below 1 μM, while the EC<sub>50</sub>s for nafamostat are generally about 10-fold lower [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1128/AAC.00754-20][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257]. These compounds, however, are largely inactive in Vero cells because Vero cells do not require TMPRSS2 for virus entry [^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629]. Camostat has protected mice from fatal SARS-CoV infection [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. It is rapidly converted into the active metabolite GBPA [^10.1101/2020.08.05.237651][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. Nafamostat is associated with higher risk of toxicity compared with camostat and was associated with hyperkalemia in four consecutive critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.12998/wjcc.v8.i21.5320]. Camostat is currently being studied in approximately 10 phase 2 and phase 2/3 trials totaling about 2,500 patients at doses ranging from 600 mg to 2400 mg per day. Nafamostat is being studied in three small open-label trials.

Aprotinin is a 58 amino acid serine protease inhibitor, which inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of about 1 μM [^10.3390/cells9112377]. It has been used in Russia intravenously and inhalationally for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. There is one ongoing open-label trial examining the response to intravenous and inhalational aprotinin in 30 patients (NCT04527133).

Bromehexine is an oral mucolytic that has been identified as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor in a high-throughput screen for the treatment of prostate cancer [^10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-1010]. However, it did not inhibit TMPRSS2 in a more recent biochemical study [^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. Neither bromehexine nor its metabolite ambroxol have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.25.221135][^10.1101/2020.09.13.295691]. However, in a randomized open-label trial of 78 patients, oral administration was reported to significantly reduce ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and death [^10.34172/bi.2020.27]. Bromhexine is being studied in one large outpatient trial (IRCT20200818048444N1) and in several small open-label trials.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) is an endogenous protease inhibitor that is also used as a treatment for persons with severe α1-AT insufficiency. The pharmaceutical form is purified from human donor blood and is sold under the nonproprietary name α1–proteinase inhibitor and under various trade names. It has been reported to inhibit TMPRSS2 biochemically [^10.1101/2020.05.04.077826]. It has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in two studies [^10.1101/2020.08.14.248880][^10.1101/2020.07.02.183764] but not in a third study [^10.3390/cells9112377]. α1-AT is being studied in a phase two placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized non-ICU patients (NCT04547140).

### Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors
DHODH is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. DHODH inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. Leflunomide is a DHODH inhibitor licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide has weak in vitro SARS-CoV-2 activity [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w]. Leflunomide was shown to reduce virus load and to improve symptomatic recovery by day 14 in a pilot open label randomized trial of 27 patients[^10.1101/2020.05.29.20114223] but it did not reduce viral clearance in an randomized open-label trial of 50 patients with prolonged post-symptomatic viral shedding [^10.1093/cid/ciaa1417]. Brequinar is a licensed DHODH inhibitor that appears to have greater activity than leflunomide in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. PTC299 is an investigational DHODH inhibitor which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w][^10.1101/2020.08.05.238394]. It is an oral drug that is being developed for oncological indications. A phase II placebo-controlled trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071). IMU-838 is an investigational DHODH inhibitor [^10.3390/v12121394] being studied in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of 230 patients (NCT04379271).

### Apilimod
Apilimod inhibits the intracellular trafficking of several viruses including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of virus replication. It inhibits a kinase enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) involved in endosomal membrane formation. Although it does not alter the pH of endosomes or inhibit cathepsin B or L, it blocks entry of multiple viruses in both pseudovirus entry experiments and in cell culture assays [^10.1073/pnas.2007837117][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. In two large scale screening assays, it was found to have EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 10 to 90 nanomolar [^10.1038/s41586-020-2577-1][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.034]. It is an investigational compound that has been studied in human clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Apilimod is being studied in a phase II trial for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (NCT04446377).

### Fluvoxamine
The sigma-1 endoplasmic reticulum receptor has been identified as a target for antiviral therapy in two large proteomic studies designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors [^10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9][^10.1126/science.abe9403]. Inhibition of the sigma-1 receptor by fluvoxamine has also  been shown to modulate the response to bacterial sepsis in a beneficial manner in a mouse model [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aau5266]. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 152 outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, none of 80 patients receiving fluvoxamine vs. 6 of 72 receiving placebo, experienced clinical deterioration over 15 days (P=0.009). A larger study of 1100 participants is currently recruiting (NCT 04668950).

### Chloroquine (CQ) analogs
CQ analogs have multiple intracellular actions that interfere with virus replication and/or the immune response to viral infections. CQ analogs are weak bases, that in their non-protonated form, concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and interfere with the trafficking of viruses that require a pH-dependent step for entry into the cytoplasm [^10.1016/s1473-3099(03)00806-5][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004502]. CQ analogs have also been reported to impair ACE2 glycosylation, which could theoretically diminish receptor binding by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69]. CQ analogs are anti-inflammatory and have been used for autoimmune conditions. CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have modest in vitro activity against MERS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], SARS-CoV [^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.085][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1038/s41598-020-70143-6] with most EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging between 1-10 μM in Vero cells but with higher EC<sub>50</sub>s in other cell lines.

Several large randomized placebo-controlled [^10.1056/NEJMoa2022926][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.7326/M20-4207] and open-label trials [^10.1056/NEJMoa2019014][^10.1136/bmj.m1849][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1009] showed no clinical or virological benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Two additional randomized trials showed that HCQ was also ineffective for post-exposure prophylaxis [^10.1056/NEJMoa2016638][^10.1056/NEJMoa2021801]. Two factors likely explain the lack of clinical efficacy of chloroquine analogs. First, cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in lung cells, depends primarily on the membrane-based enzyme TMPRSS2 rather than on endosomal fusion and acidification making it likely that the weak in vitro activity observed in Vero cells may not be clinically relevant [^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. Second, even at high dosages, CQ and HCQ do not achieve the drug levels that required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

### Ivermectin
Ivermectin is an antiparasitic agent that acts by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in the membranes of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. It has been reported to also inhibit human importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104760]. Ivermectin is a high molecular weight compound that weakly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with a reported EC<sub>50</sub> of about 2 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104787][^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. Plasma and lung levels of ivermectin following standard oral dosing have been estimated to be 10-100 fold lower than required to inhibit virus in vivo [^10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271][^10.1101/2020.04.21.20073262].

In a retrospective observational study, ivermectin use in 173 hospitalized patients was associated with significantly reduced mortality compared with 107 contemporaneous patients who did not receive ivermectin (15.0% vs. 25.2%; p=0.03), particularly in the subgroup with severe pulmonary disease defined as requiring an FiO2 >=50%, high flow oxygen, or mechanical ventilation (38.8% vs. 87.0%; p=0.001) [^10.1016/j.chest.2020.10.009]. In an open-label randomized trial of 140 patients with a wide range of disease, the time to recovery was shorter in those receiving a combination of ivermectin plus doxycycline, although there was no difference in the risk of disease progression or dying [^10.1101/2020.10.26.20219345]. As of November, ivermectin is being studied in 8 ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Niclosamide
Niclosamide is an oral anti-helminthic that exerts its antiparasitic effects by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity [^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00052]. In high-throughput drug repurposing screens, niclosamide has been found to have additional biological effects that appear to be associated either with its effect on endosomal acidification or preventing the disruption of autophagy [^10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.04.001][^10.1101/2020.04.15.997254]. Niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.48.7.2693-2696.2004][^10.1021/jm070295s], MERS-CoV [^10.1101/2020.09.24.310490], or SARS CoV-2 in cell culture with EC<sub>50</sub>s consistently below 1 μM predominantly in Vero cells. Oral, inhalational, and injectable formulations of niclosamide are being studied in nine ongoing or planned randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Nitazoxanide
Nitazoxanide is licensed for the treatment of cryptosporidium infections. It has been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses in vitro by interfering with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication including those involving interferon or mTORC1 [^10.1016/j.jiph.2016.04.001]. Its SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub> in Vero cells have been reported to be about 1 to 5 μM [^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of predominantly young outpatients with symptomatic disease, nitazoxanide did not influence time to symptom resolution but was associated with slightly more rapid virus load reductions. As of November, nitazoxanide is being studied in nine additional ongoing or planned placebo-controlled trials.

### Ciclesonide
Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid discovered in a high-throughput drug screen to inhibit coronavirus replication in the low μM range [^10.1128/JVI.01648-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582]. Although its mechanism of action is not known, MERS-CoV-2 passage in the presence of ciclesonide led to the selection of a point mutation in the nsp15 gene while multiple SARS-CoV-2 passage experiments led to nsp3 and nsp4 mutations shown to directly reduce ciclesonide susceptibility. The mutated regions of ns3 and ns4 are thought to be associated with double membrane formation. As of November, there are three ongoing randomized open-label trials and one planned placebo-controlled trial of inhaled ciclesonide.

### Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
The kinase inhibitor imatinib has been found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with EC<sub>50</sub>s of about 10 μM [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14]. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the early stages of coronavirus by affecting viral fusion with endosomal membranes specifically through ABL kinase inhibition [^10.1128/JVI.01429-16][^10.1099/jgv.0.001047]. Although imatinib also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, it has displayed inconsistent results in human alveolar cells [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1101/2020.11.17.386904][^10.1101/2020.05.05.079095]. Imatinib was also ineffective at reducing virus load or preventing weight loss in Syrian hamsters [^10.1101/2020.11.17.386904]. Imatinib is being studied in two randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Cyclophilin inhibitors
Cyclosporin and FK-506 are immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors used to prevent rejection in transplant recipients. Cyclophilins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including protein folding, protein trafficking, and cell signaling. They play a role in the replication of several viruses including HIV-1, hepatitis C, influenza, and several coronaviruses [^10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.011]. Alisporivir is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor which has been studied primarily for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. However, cyclophilin inhibitors generally have weak inhibitory effects on coronavirus replication and in mice models [^10.1099/vir.0.034983-0][^10.1099/vir.0.052910-0][^10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.011][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1183/13993003.01826-2019]. There are several ongoing open-label studies of cyclosporin and alisporivir.

### Miscellaneous
Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug used in treatment of schizophrenia that has been reported to inhibit several viruses by interfering with viral entry into cells by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis [^10.7150/ijbs.45498][^10.1038/nrd.2015.37]. Two studies reported SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 1 to 10 μM [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1101/2020.05.05.079608].

Emetine is an FDA-approved drug for treating amebiasis. It has been shown to inhibit multiple coronaviruses in vitro including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, with EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1.0 μM [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/JVI.00023-19][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582].. Its mechanism of action is uncertain, although it did inhibit MERS-CoV in an entry inhibitor assay using a pseudotype virus expressing S protein [^10.1128/JVI.00023-19]. After oral administration, its levels in the lungs are much higher than in the plasma and well above its reported EC<sub>50</sub> levels [^10.3390/ph13030051]. Emetine is currently not being studied in any SQRS-CoV-2 clinical trials.
