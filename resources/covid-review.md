## Polymerase Inhibitors

__RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp)__ catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. RdRps are highly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families[^Peersen19]. Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors are the most common antiviral compounds making up a plurality of all licensed antivirals, including those for treating herpes viruses, HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Most antiviral polymerase inhibitors lack a 3’-hydroxyl group and act as nucleoside analog chain terminators. Others contain a 3'-hydroxyl group yet still result in immediate or delayed chain termination. Finally, some nucleoside analogs become incorporated into viral genomes and inhibit replication by introducing mutations during subsequent rounds of virus replication.

Coronavirus RNA polymerization is more complex than that of other viruses. First, coronaviruses contain a 3’-to-5’ __exoribonuclease (ExoN; nsp14)__ which is required for replication fidelity[^Minskaia06]. ExoN is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of coronavirus species to ribavirin and several other nucleoside analogs [^Smith13][^Ferron18]. Second, coronavirus genomes are three times larger than most other RNA genomes and thus require increased processivity which may explain the RdRp (nsp12) requirement for two accessory proteins (nsp7 and nsp8).  Third, the coronavirus RdRp is required for transcribing multiple sub-genomic mRNAs in addition to copying the full virus genome. 3D structures of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex of SARS-CoV [^Kirchdoerfer19] and SARS-CoV-2 [^Wang20j][^Gao20b][^Yin20][^Hillen20] have been solved by cryo-EM.

### Remdesivir
__Remdesivir__ (GS-5734, Veklury) is the monophosphate prodrug of the parent 1’-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analogue __GS-441524__[^Siegel17]. The presence of the phosphate group allows for more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active nucleoside triphosphate form bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step[^Warren16]. Remdesivir is a non-obligate chain terminator in that it contains a 3’-OH group. It causes delayed chain termination due to a steric clash with S861 after the addition of three trailing nucleosides[^Gordon20][^Gordon20b][^Shannon20b][^Tchesnokov20]. The fact that chain termination does not occur until additional nucleoside triphosphates have been added explains the mechanism by which remdesivir eludes the coronavirus exonuclease.

Remdesivir has broad spectrum activity against multiple RNA viruses and inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>s) generally below 1 μM[^Sheahan17][^Agostini18][^Sheahan20][^Wang20][^Pruijssers20][^Choy20][^Jeon20]. Remdesivir inhibits coronaviruses in multiple cell types including primary human airway epithelial cells[^Sheahan17][^Pruijssers20]. Animal model experiments have demonstrated that remdesivir reduces lung virus levels and lung damage in mice infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV[^Sheahan17], rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV[^Sheahan17][^deWit20], [^Sheahan17][^deWit20], and mice and rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2[^Pruijssers20][^Williamson20].

Remdesivir resistance has been selected in a related coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), during prolonged _in vitro_ passage experiments[^Agostini18]. The remdesivir-resistant mutations are in the RdRp fingers domain. Introducing the homologous substitutions into SARS-CoV (F480L + V557L) resulted in a virus with reduced replication and about 6-fold reduced remdesivir susceptibility[^Agostini18].

As of November 2020, there were five completed randomized controlled trials of remdesivir[^Beigel20][^Wang20c][^Goldman20][^Spinner20][^WHO20]. Two were blinded[^Beigel20][^Wang20c] and four had a placebo control[^Beigel20][^Wang20c][^Spinner20][^WHO20]. The NIH Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) led to remdesivir’s FDA Emergency Use Authorization and subsequent approval[^Beigel20]. It was a multicenter trial that randomized 1063 persons with severe disease to remdesivir x 10 days vs. placebo. Patients receiving remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days vs 15 days for the placebo group (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12-1.49; p<0.001). Kaplan Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% vs. 15.2% at day 29 (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.52-1.03). A subgroup analysis showed that response to therapy was greater in those with less severe disease (i.e., those not requiring supplemental oxygen or receiving oxygen via nasal cannula) than in those with severe disease (i.e., thoserequiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation). In a post hoc analysis of deaths by Day 15, remdesivir appeared to confer a survival benefit in this subgroup who required non-high flow supplemental oxygen.

However, the large randomized open-label WHO Solidarity trial of hospitalized patients found that remdesivir was not associated with a reduction in mortality, requirement for ventilation, or reduction in hospital stay compared to a standard-of-care control group[^WHO20].  In addition, remdesivir was not associated with reductions in either upper or lower respiratory tract virus load levels in the one study that examined this outcome[^Wang20c]. Two randomized open-label studies that compared the use of 10 days vs. 5 days of remdesivir for persons with severe[^Goldman20] and moderate[^Spinner20] found no difference between the two courses of therapy

Remdesivir is administered intravenously with a loading dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily for 5 to 10 days in adult patients. Following intravenous administration, the achievable maximum remdesivir plasma concentration is predicted to be at least twice as high as its most commonly reported EC<sub>50</sub>s. However, several research groups have argued that remdesivir penetrates poorly into the lungs[^Wang20b][^Sun20b] and that there are likely to be more efficacious GS-441524 prodrugs[^Yan20][^Schooley20]. A phase I study of an inhaled nanoparticle remdesivir formulation has begun [NCT04480333](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04480333).

### MK-4482 (Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801)
__β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC)__ is a cytidine analogue that exerts its activity primarily through viral mutagenesis. It incorporates into new RNA strands and then leads to large numbers of replication errors during subsequent rounds of replication [^Pruijssers20b]. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (MK-4482 previously known as EIDD-2801) is an orally available NHC prodrug. The fact that MK-4482 is not a chain terminator likely explains the mechanism by which it eludes the proof-reading function of coronavirus exonucleases.

MK-4482 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1 μM[^Barnard04][^Barnard06][^Agostini19][^Sheahan20b]. It also has activity in primary human airway epithelial cells and reduced virus levels, disease, and lung damage in mouse models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[^Sheahan20b]. Deep sequencing studies have confirmed that viral mutagenesis is the main mechanism by which EIDD-2801 inhibits coronaviruses[^Barnard04][^Barnard06][^Agostini19][^Sheahan20b]. NHC has been reported to be mutagenic and additional reproductive toxicology studies may be required[^Zandi20].

As of November, a phase I study in uninfected individuals has been completed, two phase II studies patients with mild-to-moderate disease are nearing completion, and two large phase II/III trials have recently begun recruiting. [See all clinical trials](https://covdb.stanford.edu/clinical-trials/?compound=Molnupiravir%20%28MK-4482%2C%20EIDD-2801%29&target=Polymerase).


### Other Nucleoside Analogs
Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog with modest activity against several viruses. Although multiple mechanisms for its activity have been proposed, the most likely is an increase in viral mutagenesis. In cell culture studies, it has demonstrated little, if any, activity against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2[^Cinatl03][^Barnard04][^Chan13][^Hart14][^Falzarano13b][^Choy20][^Wang20c]. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that although ribavirin 5’-monophosphate can be incorporated during RNA synthesis, it is readily excised by the coronavirus exonuclease. Multiple observational clinical studies of patients with SARS-CoV, and to a lesser extent patients with MERS-CoV have shown no evidence for clinical benefit while demonstrating a high risk of toxicity[^Stockman06].

__Favipiravir__ (T-705) is a purine analog prodrug that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form the active metabolite ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (aka T-705-RTP). It has broad spectrum activity against multiple viral RNA polymerases and appears to act by causing viral mutagenesis[^Furuta13][^Delang18][^Shannon20]. Favipiravir is approved in Japan for treating pandemic influenza infections. It achieves high plasma concentrations following oral administration[^Du20b][^Arshad20], but has demonstrated little, if any, inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 60 to >100 μM[^Wang20][^Choy20][^Jeon20][^Shannon20]. It displays activity in a hamster model but only when used at very doses [^Kaptein20b][^Driouich20]. In an open-label randomized trial of 240 patients, of whom just 40% had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, favipiravir was associated with an improved 7 day clinical recovery rate compared to umifenovir in a subgroup of patients without critical disease (71% vs 56%; p=0.02)[^Chen20]. Two smaller open-label randomized trials showed no clinical or virological benefit associated with the favipiravir treatment[^Ivashcenko20][^Doi20].

The FDA-approved nucleoside analogs __sofosbuvir__ and tenofovir, which are used for the treatment of hepatitis C and HIV-1, respectively, are being studied in several clinical trials. However, they have little or no inhibitory activity in vitro[^Liu20c][^Sacramento20][^Zandi20]. Moreover, tenofovir has been ineffective in ferrets[^Park20]. These nucleoside analogs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in biochemical assays in the absence of exonuclease[^Chien20][^Jockusch20] [^Jockusch20b] suggesting that their lack of activity in cell culture may result in part from SARS-CoV-2's proofreading ability. One small randomized open-label study of hospitalized adults suggested that the combination of sofosbuvir and daclastavir decreased the duration of hospitalization from 8 to 6 days [^Sadeghi20]. However, daclastavir has greater in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 than does sofosbuvir[^Sacramento20]. __AT-527__ is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug of AT-511 which has been studied for the treatment of HCV, which has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro[^Good20]. It is being evaluated in two phase II placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized patients without severe disease.

## Protease Inhibitors
Coronaviruses contain two protease enzymes: 3 chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro or Main \[M\]-pro; non-structural protein 5 \[nsp5\]) and papain-like serine protease (PLpro; nsp3). 3CLpro cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at 11 sites. It is conserved among several families of RNA viruses and has similar cleavage site specificity to the picornavirus family of 3C proteases. 3CLpro contains 306 amino acids and functions as a homodimer. PLpro is part of a large multidomain transmembrane protein. It cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 boundaries and also cleaves host proteins important for innate immunity such as ubiquitin interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG-15). Many three dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro[^Jin20][^Zhang20c] and PLpro[^Osipiuk20][^Rut20][^Gao20c] have been solved and are available for structure-based drug design. However, there are more candidate 3CLpro inhibitors than PLpro inhibitors because of this enzyme’s similarities to those of other virus species and because 3CLpro is smaller and less complicated making it better able to be produced in large quantities and crystallized.

### HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors
None of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) would be expected to inhibit coronaviruses as the HIV-1 protease is an aspartate protease with different peptide specificities than the coronavirus 3CLpro and PLpro enzymes. Lopinavir boosted by ritonavir (an inhibitor of lopinavir metabolism designed to increase lopinavir levels; lopinavir/r) has nonetheless been frequently used to treat SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection largely based on the absence of other coronavirus treatment options and anecdotal reports of efficacy at treating SARS-CoV in Hong Kong in 2003[^Chan03][^Chu04]. Lopinavir displays little or no inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s of between 5 and >25 μM or higher[^Sheahan20][^Jeon20][^Choy20][^Yamamoto20]. The selectivity index of lopinavir in cell culture is low suggesting that whatever inhibition is observed in cell culture results from its toxic effects on the cells used to culture virus rather than on the virus itself. Lopinavir has been inactive against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in a biochemical assay [^Ma20].  Lopinavir/r has lacked protective activity in mice-infected with MERS-CoV[^Sheahan20] and in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2[^Park20]. In an open-label randomized controlled trial of lopinavir/r vs. standard-of-care in 199 hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and SatO<sub>2</sub> levels 94% or PaO<sub>2</sub> /FiO<sub>2</sub> <300, demonstrated no significant difference in days to virological clearance, clinical improvement, need for mechanical ventilation, or mortality[^Cao20]. The HIV-1 PIs nelfinavir and atazanavir have demonstrated variable but generally weak SARS-CoV-2 in vitro activity with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from below 1 to >50 μM[^Bakowski20][^Yamamoto20][^Ohashi20][^Jeon20][^Fintelman-Rodrigues20];  darunavir has consistently displayed no inhibitory coronavirus activity[^Meyer20][^Yamamoto20].

### 3CLpro Investigational Inhibitors
3CLpro has a unique substrate preference (Leu-Gln ↓ {Ser, Ala, Gly}) that is not shared by any known human protease suggesting the potential for increased antiviral selectivity. There have been many drug screens and structure-based designs targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro that inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical (IC<sub>50</sub>s) and cell culture (EC<sub>50</sub>s) ranging from about 0.01 to 1 μM[^Shie05][^Ma20][^Kumar16][^Zhang20][^Zhang20c][^Hattori20]. These compounds belong to several series of reversible and covalently binding irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitors, many of which have been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro[^Zhang20][^Dai20][^Jin20].

__GC376__ has been effectively used for treating cats with the rapidly fatal coronavirus disease FIPV[^Kim16b]. It forms covalent bonds with the 3CL active site cysteine and inhibits multiple coronaviruses[^Kim12]. Its IC<sub>50</sub> against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro ranges from 0.03 to 1.5 μM while its EC<sub>50</sub> in cell culture ranges from 0.2 to 3.4 μM[^Ma20][^Vuong20][^Luan20]. Crystal structures of MERS-CoV 3CLpro bound to GC376 have led to the identification of piperidene peptidomimetics with greater SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inhibitory activity[^Galasiti18]. GC376 is considered a promising lead compound for further development [^Iketani20][^Sacco20]. The approved HCV protease inhibitor __boceprevir__ displays 3CLpro inhibitory activity and is also considered a promising lead compound [^Ma20][^Fu20].

__Ebselen__ is a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activity that has been studied for the treatment of a wide variety of illnesses. It was found to inhibit 3CLpro in a high-throughput drug screen and to have inhibitory activity in biochemical and cell culture of ~1 μM[^Jin20]. It appears to inhibit 3CLpro allosterically[^Menendez20]. It is being studied as an oral drug in two phase II randomized placebo controlled trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and severe disease.

The compounds with the greatest 3CLpro inhibitory activity include both reversible and covalently binding irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitors, many of which have been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro[^Zhang20][^Dai20][^Jin20][^Hoffman20]. The most potent of these __PF-00835231__ has an IC<sub>50</sub> in a biochemical assay of 0.0003 μM and an EC<sub>50</sub> in cell culture of 0.2 μM [^Hoffman20][^Vries20]. It has undergone extensive safety studies and pharmacokinetic profiling in rats, dogs, and monkeys [^Boras20]. __PF-07304814__ is an intravenously administered phosphate prodrug of PF-00835231, which is being studied in a phase I trial.


### PLpro Investigational Inhibitors
In contrast to 3CLpro, the PLpro enzyme is a multidomain membrane-associated protein, making it more challenging to study in vitro. Nonetheless, several crystal structures have been reported[^Osipiuk20][^Rut20][^Gao20c] and several lead compounds have been identified including 6-thioguanine, which displays sub-micromolar activity in enzymatic and cell culture studies [^Swaim20][^Klemm20].

## Entry Inhibitors
Coronavirus cell entry is mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein. S is a membrane protein essential for the two main steps of the entry process: attachment to the host cell and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The functional S protein is a trimer of identical subunits. For most coronaviruses, S is processed by host proteases to generate two functional subunits, designated S1 and S2. The S1 subunit forms the apex of the S trimer including the receptor binding domains (RBDs)[^Tortorici19] and is responsible for attachment to cellular receptors. The S2 unit is responsible for fusion to the cell membrane.

The 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer has been determined by cryo-EM[^Wrapp20b]. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)[^Li03][^Zhou20c]. An extended insertion within the structurally similar SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs called the receptor-binding motif (RBM) contains most of the S amino acids responsible for ACE2 binding[^Wong04][^Lan20b][^Xu20e]. S binding to ACE2 does not interfere with ACE2’s catalytic activity[^Li05]. However, ACE2 internalization following infection leads to the loss of ACE2’s lung protective effects. S1-ACE2 affinity is higher for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, possibly explaining its greater infectiousness[^Lan20b].

S2 contains two complementary heptad repeat (HR) regions, designated HR1 and HR2, which are alpha helices with repeated patterns of seven amino acids that have regions that can bind to one another. HR1 projects out to the host cell membrane whereas HR2 is about 170 amino acids upstream and closer to the virus membrane[^Millet15]. HR1 and HR2 collapse onto one another to create a hairpin which brings the viral and cell membranes together promoting fusion. As S2 (like S1) functions as a trimer, the hairpin formed by the interaction of HR1 and HR2 is referred to as a six-helix bundle.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two main cleavage sites. One is at the S1/S2 boundary and the other is at a site within S2 referred to as the S2’ site. These sites must be cleaved by host proteases in order for the S1 and S2 to undergo the necessary conformational changes to shift from receptor binding to cell fusion[^Tortorici19]. The specific cleavage sites, the responsible host enzymes, and the cellular locations at which cleavage occurs varies among different coronaviruses and likely also in different cell types; this variation is believed to play a role in cellular tropism and pathogenesis[^Millet15][^Tortorici19]. Several candidate host proteases appear to be particularly important for processing S1 and S2, including TMPRSS2, a surface transmembrane serine protease, endosomal cathepsins, and furin. In contrast, to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which is cleaved during biosynthesis[^Walls20][^Coutard20]. It has been speculated that the presence of this cleavage site may have expanded the transmissibility and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 considering the more widespread expression of furin-like proteases in host cells.

This section describes interventions that interfere with virus entry including convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies that block S1 receptor binding, fusion inhibitors, and several other receptor binding inhibitors. Compounds that inhibit the host protease enzymes required for cleaving the S protein are described in the section on host-acting compounds.

### Monoclonal Antibodies
Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been used to treat Ebola[^Corti16][^Mulangu19] and prevent respiratory syncytial virus[^Scott99] infections. Neutralizing MAbs have also be shown to reduce virus levels in HIV-1-infected persons but resistance emerges unless a combination of neutralizing MAbs is administered[^Caskey17][^Mendoza18].

Recovery during SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 is usually associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies[^Jin17][^Okba20][^Suthar20][^Lee20]. These neutralizing antibodies nearly always target the S1 protein, particularly its receptor binding domain[^Coughlin12][^Han18][^Xu19]. Within the past three months, there have been more than 20 published studies describing the isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Some studies describe the development of mAbs intended for COVID-19 treatment and prevention while other studies were performed primarily to characterize the genetic and structural basis of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. These studies include data on the (1) antibody source, (2) antigen bait used to isolate SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs; (3) mAb cloning and expression; (4) functional screening; (5) structural studies; (6) escape mutations; (7) Fc-dependent effector mechanisms; and (8) activity in animal models. Four groups have begun clinical trials ([Clinical Trials of Monoclonal Antibody](linic-tria/#Monoclonalntibody)) including two that have published studies [^Shi20][^Hansen20][^Baum20].

**Antibody source:** The most common source of mAbs has been convalescent B cells from persons with a history of SARS-CoV-2. Convalescent B cells from persons with a history of SARS-CoV-1 have been used by several groups early in the pandemic to determine whether any SARS-CoV-1 mAbs cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 or to identify mAbs that might neutralize a broader spectrum of variants [^Yuan20b][^Huo20][^Tian20][^Pinto20][^Wec20]. Two groups immunized mice including H2L2[^Wang20b] and VelocImmune[^Hansen20] mice. The mAbs isolated from immunized VelocImmune mice were reported to have similar sequences to those isolated by the same group from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent B cells. One group used a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display libraries from naïve B cells [^Li20b] and another from a SARS-1 scFv library[^Yuan20d].

**Antigen bait:** Three main bait antigens have been used to identify reactive B cells, immunize transgenic mice, or pan phage display antibody fragments: the S1 receptor binding domain (RBD); the complete S1 protein; and the S trimer – often referred to as the trimeric extracellular or prefusion ectodomain. Less commonly used antigens have including the S1 N-terminal domain (NTD)[^Zost20] and an S tetramer[^Wec20]. Although most highly potent neutralizing mAbs bind to the S1 RBD, groups additional antigens would be expected to identify a broader spectrum of mAbs.

**Cloning, expression, and sequencing:** The most commonly used approach for cloning mAbs has involved sorting individual B cells followed by the physical linking of VH and VL regions through molecular techniques. Complete mAbs are then be expressed in IgG expression vectors or less commonly in immortalized B cells. The extent to which the above processes are automated through advances in microfluidics dictates the numbers of mAbs that can be generated and sequenced. High-throughput clonal sequencing has yielded insight into the variable heavy and light chain germ-line repertoire and extent of somatic hypermutation in antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Most antibodies have undergone minimal somatic hypermutation (0% to less than 10%) partly because convalescent plasma samples have been obtained within weeks following illness.  Most studies have reported that certain VH and VL genes are over-represented in neutralizing mAbs. Nonetheless, many neutralizing mAbs arise from diverse VH and VL repertoires.

**Functional screening:** Some groups have described cloning and sequencing of hundreds SARS-CoV-2 recognizing mAbs[^Brouwer20][^Chi20][^Ju20][^Liu20e][^Robbiani20][^Rogers20]. To some extent, these sequences make it possible to filter out mAbs that are likely defective or duplicative. However, ultimately functional assays are required to identify which mAbs have therapeutic potential – including neutralizing assays using pseudoviruses and infectious virus assays. ELISA, biolayer-inferometry, and surface plasmon resonance assays are used to determine binding affinity to RBD, S1, and trimeric spike, to determine the extent to which mAbs compete with ACE2 or other mAbs with known epitopes, and to perform low-resolution epitope mapping.

**Structural studies:** X-ray crystallography has been used to determine the structure of the Fab portion of an mAb bound to the spike RBD [^Huo20][^Ju20][^Shi20][^Yuan20b][^Wu20] while CryoEM has been used to the structure of Fabs bound to trimeric S [^Cao20c][^Chi20][^Hansen20][^Pinto20]. Both types of structures make it possible to identify the spike residues interacting with an mAb and the surface area buried by the interaction. Low resolution structures determined using negative staining EM also contribute to epitope mapping. The most potent mAbs identified so far bind to the part of RBD that binds ACE2, also referred to as the receptor binding motif. Several groups have also identified non-ACE2 competing mAbs that bind to a part of the RBD called the core domain [^Pinto20][^Wec20][^Yuan20b][^Zost20b]. While non-ACE2 competing mAbs have been on average less potent, they have a broader spectrum of activity, inhibiting SARS-CoV-1 and other members of the sarbecovirus clade.

**Resistance selection and mAb combinations:** The vulnerability of a mAb to mutational escape and the development of resistance can be inferred in part by the degree of conservation at each mAb-interacting spike residue. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies have also been performed to predict the effects of published spike variants[^Baum20][^Pinto20][^Zost20b]. One group selected for mAb-resistance mutations in virus culture[^Baum20]. Several groups identified potentially synergistic mAbs that bind non-overlapping sites[^Baum20][^Pinto20][^Wu20].

**Fc-dependent effector mechanisms:** Two groups described assays to assess the effects of mAbs on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)[^Hansen20][^Pinto20]. In an attempt to reduce the likelihood of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, another group introduced an Fc LALA mutation to reduce FcγR and C1q mAb binding[^Shi20].

**Animal model studies:** Six groups evaluated mAbs in animal models including rhesus macaques[^Shi20], Syrian hamsters[^Rogers20], and various transgenic mice species[^Rogers20][^Li20b][^Wu20][^Zost20b]. These studies aim to demonstrate _in vivo_ potency and to ascertain the risk of ADE[^Zost20b].

___Conclusions: During the past month, more than 20 groups have described the development of mAbs able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Four mAbs have begun clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.___

### Fusion Inhibitors
Peptides that mimic HR2 can block virus-cell fusion by preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2. The HIV-1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide is a 36 amino acid peptide that acts by this mechanism following subcutaneous administration[^Lalezari03][^Lazzarin03][^Matthews04]. Several peptide mimics of coronavirus HR2 have been shown to be potently inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 _in vitro_[^Yuan04][^Lu14][^Channappanavar15][^Wang18][^Xia19b][^Zhu20] and reviewed by Tang et al[^Tang20b]. The interest in coronavirus fusion inhibitors derives in part because S2 is more conserved than S1 among different coronavirus species. For example, the S1 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 differ by more than 10% of their amino acids. However, their HR1 domains differ by 7% and their HR2 domains are essentially identical[^Xia20b]. Fusion inhibitors would be expected to have greater activity in preventing viral fusion occurring via the cell surface rather than the endosomal pathway of virus entry[^Ujike08][^Tang20b].

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an HR2 mimicking peptide named EK1 was identified as a potential broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor as it inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at sub-micromolar levels and was found to safe and protective against MERS-CoV when administered intra-nasally to SARS-CoV-infected mice[^Xia19b]. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 six helix bundle was solved, and several modifications were made to the EK1 peptide. In addition, a cholesterol group was added[^Xia20] as lipidation had recently been shown to improve the pharmacokinetics and inhibitory activity of viral fusion inhibitors[^Chong17]. This new lipopeptide, named EK1C4 was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 fusion 150 times more strongly than EK1, with SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub>s of 0.04 μM and 0.004 μM in cell culture for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and with even lower EC<sub>50</sub>s in cell-cell fusion assays. Two other HR2-mimicking lipopeptide IPB02 and IPB04 have also been highly active in cell-cell fusion and pseudotype virus assays[^Zhu20].

___Conclusion: Further animal model studies or a phase I/II study are needed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy of a fusion inhibitor such as EK1C4.___

### Soluble ACE2 and Other Molecular Decoys
Soluble __recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2)__ has two potential beneficial effects. First, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rhACE2 was shown to protect lungs from injury during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[^Imai05][^Kuba05][^Khan17][^Monteil20]. Second, rhACE2 inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells[^Hofmann04][^Wang20i] and has displayed dose-dependent activity _in vitro_ against SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells and engineered human blood vessel and kidney organoids[^Monteil20]. APN1 (Apeiron Biologics) is a recombinant form of human ACE2, that demonstrated safety in 89 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients and volunteers. It is now being evaluated in a 200-person placebo-controlled study of hospitalized persons with SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04335136). A similar approach involving the use of a fusion protein – in which an inactive ACE2 mutant is linked to a human Fc IgG – has also been shown to be highly active _in vitro_[^Lei20].

The complete ACE2 molecule may not be necessary to inhibit viral infection if a synthetic peptide can be constructed with a critical minimal subset of ACE2 amino acids capable of competing with cellular ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)[^Linsky20][^Glasgow20][^Li05]. In fact, avoiding the use of complete ACE2 proteins may avoid the theoretical risk of stimulating an inappropriate autoimmune response to ACE2[^Linsky20]. One study suggested that multiple residues from different parts of the ACE2 molecule would be required including amino acids between positions 24–90 and 329–354 inhibited SARS-CoV[^Li05] while another similarly designed protein CTC-445.2d inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in pseudovirus assays at low nanomolar concentrations and achieved functional lung and plasma concentrations in mice following the inhalation of intranasal droplets[^Linsky20].  Another peptide comprising two discontinuous ACE2 segments containing residues 22–44 and 351–357 artificially linked together by glycine, exhibited potent _in vitro_ activity against SARS-CoV with an EC<sub>50</sub> of about 0.1 μM[^Han06]. Several short ACE2-derived peptides have also demonstrated some _in vitro_ activity against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 including one comprising peptides between positions 22–57[^Han06] and another containing 23 amino acid N terminal fragments that bind the S1 receptor binding domain[^Zhang20g].

___Conclusion: rhACE2 may prove to be useful in patients with severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.___

### Additional Possible Entry Inhibitors
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells and have been shown to serve as attachment sites for SARS-CoV and other viruses[^Lang11][^Chang20]. Several compounds that inhibit the interaction between viruses and HSPGs have antiviral activity including lactoferrin and certain anticoagulants. Lactoferrin is a mammalian antimicrobial protein found in multiple secretory fluids, which has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 _in vitro_[^Lang11][^Mirabelli20]. It is available as an over-the- counter supplement and is being studied orally and intranasally for the treatment of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. The anticoagulants  heparin, enoxaparin, and pixatimod bind to S1 receptor binding domains and interfere with virus cell entry by this mechanism[^Mycroft-West20][^Tandon20][^Guimond20]. Administration of heparin intranasally has also been proposed as a method of preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 after initial infection without increasing the risk of bleeding[^Tandon20].

Spike-mimicking 20-mer peptides corresponding to different S1 and/or S2 regions were reported in one study to synergistically interfere with SARS-CoV entry into cells presumably by competing with complete virus for ACE2 binding[^Zheng05]. However, few studies have described this approach and the inhibition of ACE2 enzymatic function or down-regulation of ACE2 levels is precarious as the absence of ACE2 is associated with the same pulmonary and cardiovascular disturbances observed during severe SARS-CoV and presumably SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Griffithsin, a 121 amino acid protein isolated from red algae, inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV _in vitro_ with EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 μM without inducing cell toxicity. It also inhibits SARS-CoV when delivered intranasally in a mouse model[^OKeefe10][^Millet16]. Time course experiments suggest that griffithsin interferes with virus cell entry[^Millet16]. While ELISA assays showed that it binds directly to the S glycoprotein, it does not inhibit S binding to ACE2 suggesting it may prevent subsequent steps needed for viral entry[^OKeefe10].

Umifenovir (aka arbidol) is an oral drug used in Russia and China to treat influenza and other viral infections[^Blaising14][^Pecheur16]. It is reported to have _in vitro_ activity against multiple viruses and to inhibit viral entry by binding viral surface glycoproteins[^Leneva09]. Its SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub>s have been reported to be between 5 and 10 μM with a selectivity index of about 8[^Touret20][^Wang20d]. A crystal structure of umifenovir in complex with influenza hemagglutinin showed it binding a hydrophobic cavity in the hemagglutinin trimer stem[^Kadam17]. There have been two open-label controlled trials in patients with SARS-CoV-2[^Chen20][^Li20] and several small retrospective observational studies[^Deng20][^Zhu20b][^Zhou20] which have demonstrated lack of clinical efficacy.

Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by white blood cells and epithelial cells, which have a role in innate immunity. In a study of several peptides derived from mouse β-defensin-4, one 30 amino acid peptide called P9 was found to inhibit influenza A, MERS-Co-V, and SARS-CoV both _in vitro_ and in a mouse model[^Zhao16].

VE607 was reported in one study to inhibit SARS-CoV S protein-ACE2-mediated cell entry[^Kao04] but does not appear to have been studied further. HTCC polymers are cationically modified chitosan derivatives that appear to inhibit cell entry of multiple coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV[^Milewska20][^Milewska16]. SARS-RBD-hexapeptide is weak inhibitor of SARS-CoV viral entry, but nonetheless suggests the possibility that small peptides may be able to inhibit the interaction of coronavirus S1 receptor binding domains and ACE2[^Struck12]. Emodin is a plant derivative that appears to weakly inhibit SARS-CoV S protein-ACE2-mediated cell entry[^Ho07], although it has also been proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV release from cells[^Schwarz11].

___Conclusion: Heparin and enoxaparin are increasingly being used to prevent clotting in persons with severe disease. They may also have a direct antiviral effect. Intranasal administration in early less severe infections should be studied. The remaining compounds in this section have not been  well studied.___


## Convalescent Plasma
There is a strong biological rationale for the use of passive immunotherapeutic approaches to treat viral infections. Indeed, the FDA has approved immunoglobulin preparations for the treatment of hepatitis B, varicella, cytomegalovirus, and rabies infection [^Pau20]. Nonetheless, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been just one randomized control trial of convalescent plasma for the treatment of a viral infection [^Maiztegui79]. It demonstrated that convalescent plasma dramatically reduced mortality in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever. A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies of convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin for SARS-CoV was considered inconclusive[^Stockman06], while a larger, more recent meta-analysis of 32 studies of SARS-CoV and influenza, reported that administration of convalescent plasma early after symptom onset showed a significant 75% reduction in the pooled odds of mortality compared with placebo or no therapy[^Mair-Jenkins15].

Many controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 have now been published. The largest studies have been uncontrolled. The first was a safety review of the first 20,000 patients receiving convalescent plasma in the U.S. under an FDA Expanded Access Program[^Joyner20c]. In this study, 71% were classified as having severe or life-threatening diseases and 29% were judged to be at high risk of progressing to severe or life-threatening disease. The risk of severe adverse events considered related to transfusion was about 0.5%. A follow-up expanded efficacy analysis of this population reported a 7-day mortality of 8.7% in patients transfused within 3 days of diagnosis compared with 11.9% in patients transfused after 3 days (p<0.001)[^Joyner20b]. As the ability to receive early treatment is a major confounder of clinical outcome, the more important finding from this uncontrolled study was that the 7-day mortality was significantly reduced for those who received plasma with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers. Two other observational studies also reported that early transfusion with convalescent plasma containing higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers was associated with clinical improvement[^Salazar20][^Liu20d].

Among the published randomized trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment, one was a placebo-controlled trial of non-ventilated patients with severe disease[^Simonovich20], another was a placebo controlled trial of high-risk patients with symptoms for less than 72 hours[^Libster20], and four were open-label trials of patients with severe diseases[^Agarwal20][^Li20c][^Avendano-Sola20][^Gharbharan20]. In five of the six studies, the the mean donor IgG titer was considered to be in the therapeutic range of >1:160[^Simonovich20][^Libster20][^Li20c][^Avendano-Sola20][^Gharbharan20]. The placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe disease reported no difference in clinical status at D30 for convalescent plasma recipients compared with the control group[^Simonovich20]. The second placebo-controlled trial reported that convalescent plasma significantly reduced the risk of severe respiratory disease (12% vs 30%; p=0.007) among high-risk patients with early disease[^Libster20]. One of the four open-label studies reported a significantly reduced mortality (0/38; 0% vs. 6/43; 14%; p=0.03) for those receiving convalescent plasma[^Avendano-Sola20]. A second reported a significant clinical improvement associated with convalescent plasma for the subgroup of patients with severe but not critical disease [^Li20c].

In conclusion, convalescent plasma may reduce the risk of severe illness when it contains sufficiently high IgG titers and is used in high-risk persons with early disease. Nonetheless, additional clinical trials using plasma units containing high titers of neutralizing antibodies and comparisons with monoclonal antibodies would be useful.


## Interferons
In response to cellular changes suggestive of a viral infection, interferons (IFNs) inducing numerous  genes (IFN-stimulated genes \[ISGs\]) that encode proteins which inhibit viral replication by slowing cellular metabolism, interfering with membrane formation required for virus replication, and inducing cytokines that promote adaptive immunity[^Sallard20]. There are three IFN families[^McNab15]. Type I IFNs includes 13 related __IFN-α__ subtypes, __IFN-β__, and several poorly defined single gene products including IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω. Type II IFN consists of a single gene product IFN-γ. Type III IFN consists of __IFN-λ1__, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3.

Several IFN-α preparations have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus, and several malignancies. IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, congenital immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease, and hepatitis delta infection, respectively. Commercial IFN-α preparations vary in the extent to which they include different IFN-α subtypes, although the biological and clinical significance of the differences between these preparations are not known[^Wang19c]. Pegylated interferons have a longer half-life because the attached polyethylene glycol delays IFN clearance.

The importance of IFNs for combatting SARS-CoV-2 is underscored by the fact that many viruses, particularly coronaviruses encode multiple proteins that antagonize cellular IFN signaling pathways[^Wang19c][^deWit16]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 encode approximately 10 proteins that allow virus to escape or counteract IFN induction or antiviral action[^Ribero20][^Totura12]. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a reduced IFN response in some studies[^Blanco-Melo20][^Hadjadj20] and an increased response in other studies[^Zhou20d]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to increase ACE2 expression in upper airway cells[^Ziegler20]. Supporting a role for IFNs in protection against SARS-CoV-2 is the finding that about 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 have neutralizing type I IFN autoantibodies[^Bastard20].

IFN-α and IFN-β and to a lesser extent IFN-λ demonstrate inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations (100 to 1000 IU/ml) in Vero and Calu3 cell lines and in primary human alveolar cells[^Lokugamage20][^Mantlo20][^Felgenhauer20][^Vanderheiden20][^Busnadiego20]. Two _in vitro_ studies suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to Type I IFNs than SARS-CoV possibly because of a deletion in ORF3b, a 154 amino acid protein known to antagonize one of the proteins involved in the IFN response[^Lokugamage20][^Felgenhauer20]. IFN-α and IFN-β have demonstrated protective effects against SARS and MERS in mice[^Barnard06][^Kumaki11] and macaque[^Haagmans04][^Smits10][^Falzarano13] models while IFN-λ has demonstrated protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 in one mouse model[^Dinnon20]. However, three studies have reported worse outcomes in mouse models of SARS and MERS when the administration of type I IFNs is delayed[^Channappanavar16][^Channappanavar19][^Sheahan20].

There has been one phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial of nebulized IFN-β in non-ventilated hospitalized patients receiving supplementary oxygen[^Monk20], two phase II randomized placebo-controlled trials of subcutaneous IFN-λ in outpatients with mild disease[^Jagannathan20][^Feld20], two randomized open-label trials of IFN-β including the SOLIDARITY trial[^WHO20][^Davoudi-Monfared20], one open-label trial of IFN-α[^Zheng20], and one open-label trial of IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin[^Hung20]. Nebulized IFN-β was found to be associated with an improved outcome as 6 of 48 patients in the IFN group vs. 11 of 51 patients in the placebo group developed severe disease or died[^Monk20]. The larger of the two IFN-λ studies showed no virological benefit[^Jagannathan20] whereas the smaller study reported lower virus loads at day 7 in a post-hoc adjusted analysis[^Feld20]. Among the open-label trials, the strongest signal of efficacy was a shorter time to viral clearance and more rapid clinical improvement in patients receiving IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin[^Hung20]. The NIH treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of IFNs for the treatment of severely ill patients with COVID-19 but provide no recommendation for the use of IFNs in earlier disease. Based on the single positive phase II trial of nebulized IFN-β in non-ventilated hospitalized patients additional trials would be useful.


## Host-Targeting Compounds
With the exception of interferons, all approved antivirals target specific steps in a virus’s replication cycle. However, the concept of developing drugs that target host pathways has gained increasing interest during the past several years and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Host-acting drugs have a number of theoretical advantages for treating acute pandemic infections. First, host acting antiviral drugs may have already been approved or undergone human testing for other conditions, making it possible to repurpose them to treat SARS-CoV-2. Second, host-acting drugs might be able to inhibit multiple viruses, since many viruses depend on similar host factors and pathways. Third, although drugs targeting host factors may have a higher risk of cellular toxicity compared to drugs that specifically target a virus protein, such toxicity may be acceptable for the relatively few days required to treat an acute viral infection.

During the past 17 years, many compounds have been identified that appear to inhibit coronaviruses _in vitro_ by inhibiting a cellular protein, influencing a signaling pathway, or modifying a cellular organelle. For some of these compounds, it has been possible to determine their mechanism of action. However, it is difficult to pinpoint the mechanism of action for many other compounds. This section reviews compounds that appear to act primarily by influencing the host rather than the virus and that are described in multiple studies, demonstrate _in vitro_ potency, and have favorable safety profiles. These compounds have been categorized into those that (i) inhibit host proteases required for S protein cleavage; (ii) appear to inhibit virus endosomal trafficking;  (iii) have been reported to stimulate host immunity; or (iv) act by additional or uncertain mechanisms.

### Host Protease Inhibitors
The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is critical for the virus to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. Many host proteases have been shown to proteolytically process the spike (S) protein including cell surface proteases such as transmembrane protease/serine proteases (TMPRSSs) and related type II transmembrane serine proteases, furin, trypsin, and endosomal cathepsins[^Millet15][^Tang20b]. Coronaviruses usually require that S is cleaved at two sites – the S1/S2 boundary and at a second site within S2 referred to as S2’. The specific enzymes involved depend in part on the virus species, the amino acid sequence at the S1/S2 boundary and at the S2’ site, and the infected cells.

In contrast to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 contains a functional poly-basic furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary[^Walls20]. This observation and accumulating data strongly suggest that __furin__ and __TMPRSS2__ are likely to mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary and at S2’, respectively, and thus are likely to be particularly important host proteases for SARS-CoV-2[^Hoffmann20][^Bestle20]. Endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L are considered essential host proteases for SARS-CoV[^Simmons05][^Glowacka11][^Shulla11][^Kawase12][^Shirato18][^Hoffmann20][^Bestle20] but they appear to be less important for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into  cells[^Bestle20][^Yamamoto20b][^Ou20b].

Two serine protease inhibitors used in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, __camostat__ and __nafamostat__, inhibit coronaviruses through their inhibition of TMPRSS2. Both drugs inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in pseudovirus entry assays and in cell culture[^Hoffmann20][^Hoffmann20b][^Yamamoto20b][^Bojkova20]. Camostat has also protected mice from fatal SARS-CoV infection[^Zhou15]. Both camostat and nafamostat appear to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at lower concentrations than SARS-CoV[^Hoffmann20][^Hoffmann20b][^Yamamoto20b][^Bojkova20]. Camostat has also been shown to inhibit other type II transmembrane serine proteases[^Hoffmann20d].

In Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells, camostat inhibited SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s generally below 1 μM, while the EC<sub>50</sub>s for nafamostat have been about 10 to 100-fold lower. However, the EC<sub>50</sub>s for both drugs against both viruses are considerably higher in Vero cells likely because these cells do not require TMPRSS2 for virus replication[^Jeon20][^Yamamoto20b][^Bestle20][^Yamamoto20b][^Bojkova20b]. Two studies have reported that aprotonin, a third serine protease inhibitor available in Russia as an aerosol preparation displayed comparable inhibitory activity to camostat[^Bojkova20][^Bestle20]. The FDA approved drug, __alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT)__ has also been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2 [^Azouz20]; It is being studied in three clinical trials intravenously and via inhalation.

Camostat mesylate is rapidly converted into its active metabolite GBPA in animals and humans. __FOY-251__, a methanesulfonate of GBPA has been reported to also inhibit TMPRSS2 but at a somewhat reduced capacity compared with camostat[^Hoffmann20d].

Several synthetic furin inhibitors have been shown to inhibit coronaviruses _in vitro_ including MI-1851, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 alone and synergistically in combination with TMPRSS2 inhibitors[^Bestle20], while dec-RVKR-CMK, which weakly inhibited MERS-CoV in a pseudovirus entry assay[^Millet14].

___Conclusion: As of August, there are 15 ongoing or planned clinical trials of camostat, nafamostat, or alpha 1 antitrypsin but few are placebo controlled. This class of inhibitors appear to be among the most promising repurposed drugs for treating COVID-19.___

### Additional Host-Targeting Compounds
__Apilimod__ inhibits the intracellular trafficking of several viruses including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of virus replication. It inhibits a kinase enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) involved in endosomal membrane formation. Although it does not alter the pH of endosomes or inhibit cathepsin B or L, it blocks entry of multiple viruses in pseudovirus and cell culture assays[^Kang20][^Ou20b]. In two large scale screening assays, it was found to be one of the most inhibitory compounds with EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 10 to 90 nanomolar[^Riva20][^Bouhaddou20]. It is an investigational compound that has been studied in human clinical trials as an anticancer agent and is now being studied in a phase II trial for the treatment of COVID-19.

__DHODH inhibitors__: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. DHODH inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. __Leflunomide__ is a licensed drug for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide has been shown to have weak _in vitro_ SARS-CoV-2 activity[^Xiong20b]. Leflunomide was shown to reduce virus load and to increase recovery by day 14 in a clinical trial of 27 patients[^Wang20g]. Several other investigational DHODH inhibitors have exhibited much greater _in vitro_ activity including __PTC299__ which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^Xiong20b][^Luban20]. PTC299 is an oral drug that is also being developed for oncological indications and has been studied in nine clinical trials in over 300 individuals. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071). __IMU-838__ and __brequinar__ are two other compounds acting by this mechanism.

__Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogs__ have been reported to have multiple intracellular actions that interfere with virus replication and/or the immune response to viral infections. CQ analogs are weak bases, that in their non-protonated form, penetrate and concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. In these organelles, CQ analogs may interfere with the trafficking of viruses that require a pH-dependent step for entry[^Savarino03][^Burkard14]. CQ analogs have also been reported to impair ACE2 glycosylation, which could theoretically diminish receptor binding by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2[^Vincent05]. CQ analogs also anti-inflammatory, and have been used for autoimmune conditions. CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have modest inhibitory activity _in vitro_ against MERS-CoV[^Dyall14][^Shin18][^deWilde14], SARS-CoV[^Vincent05][^Barnard06][^Keyaerts04][^deWilde14], and SARS-CoV-2[^Wang20][^Liu20][^Yao20][^Jeon20][^Fintelman-Rodrigues20][^Clementi20][^Touret20] with most EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging between 1 μM and 10 μM.

However, two large blinded and three large open-label randomized control trials totaling more than 6,000 patients failed to show any clinical or virological benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine[^Horby20][^Skipper20][^Calvacanti20][^Tang20][^Mitja20b]. Two additional randomized controlled studies totaling more than 3,000 patients failed to show a reduction in the risk of infection among exposed patients receiving HCQ[^Mitja20][^Boulware20].  The lack of efficacy likely reflects the fact that  at standard dosages, CQ and HCQ do not achieve sufficiently high inhibitory drug levels[^Tett89][^Ducharme96][^Lim09][^Garcia-Cremades20][^Arshad20] and because cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in lung cells, depends primarily on the membrane based enzyme TMPRSS2 rather than on endosomal fusion and acidification[^Hoffmann20c][^Ou20].

__Niclosamide__ is an oral anti-helminthic drug that has been used in millions of persons worldwide. It appears to exert it anti-helminthic effects by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity[^Xu20f]. In high-throughput drug repurposing screens, niclosamide has been found to have several additional biological effects that appear to be associated either with its effect on endosomal acidification or with its influence on signaling pathways[^Chen18]. Five research groups reported that niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV[^Wen07][^Wu04b], MERS-CoV[^Ko20], or SARS-CoV-2[^Gassen20][^Jeon20] in cell culture with EC<sub>50</sub>s consistently below 1 μM. One study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 facilitates AKT1/SKPT-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 and that reversal of this effect by niclosamide and the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 markedly inhibits SARS-CoV-2[^Gassen20]. Although niclosamide dosing has generally been designed to achieve high intestinal levels, a recent pharmacokinetic review suggested that even at current doses, its maximal plasma concentration may be sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication[^Arshad20]. In addition, a phase I study of intramuscular niclosamide was posted to ClinicalTrials.gov in August.

__Chlorpromazine__ is an antipsychotic drug used in treatment of schizophrenia that has been reported to inhibit several viruses by interfering with viral entry into cells by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis[^Zumla16][^Yang20c]. Four studies have reported EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 1 to 14 μM for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[^Dyall14][^deWilde14][^Cong18][^Weston20].

__K22__ is a small molecule found to inhibit the double membrane formation and reticular vesicular network required for the replication of coronaviruses and other positive strand RNA viruses[^Lundin14][^Rappe18]. Although it has weak _in vitro_ activity, it is of interest because it appears to act at a novel stage of infection; furthermore, K22-resistant viruses containing nsp6 mutations were selected after 10 passages of HCoV-229E suggesting that this compound may also have specific antiviral activity[^Lundin14].

__Signaling pathway inhibitors__: High-throughput experiments have been performed for some viral infections to identify host proteins essential for virus infection but not cell viability. These have not yet been reported for coronavirus infections. However, several transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have described perturbations in cellular signaling pathways raising the possibility that drugs that influence the kinase proteins involved in these pathways might influence coronavirus replication[^Josset13][^Kindler13][^Kindrachuk15]. One encyclopedic proteomic SARS-CoV-2 study described the many interactions between virus and host proteins but was not primarily focused on signaling pathways[^Gordon20c].

The kinase inhibitors dasatinib and imatinib were found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with EC<sub>50</sub>s of 2.1 and 5.4 μM for dasatinib and 9.8 and 17.7 μM for imatinib[^Dyall14]. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses possibly by affecting viral fusion with endosomal membranes; inhibition was demonstrated to occur specifically through ABL kinase inhibition[^Coleman16][^Sisk18]. At least one pharmacokinetic study suggested, however, that standard doses of imatinib would be associated with plasma levels considerably lower than the EC<sub>50</sub>s reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV[^Arshad20]. As of July, imatinib is listed in eight ongoing or planned clinical trials including two placebo-controlled trials. It appears, however, that in these studies imatinib is being studied primarily for its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis. Another kinase inhibitor, saracatinib, has also recently been shown to inhibit several coronaviruses in the low μM range[^Shin18]

__Interferon inducers__: Several compounds appear to inhibit viruses by inducing interferon. Ampligen® is a mismatched double-stranded RNA polymer that stimulates the production of interferon. It has been reported to have _in vitro_ activity against several viruses[^Gowen07] including SARS-CoV [^Barnard06]. It has also been reported to protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge in three studies[^Barnard06][^Day09][^Kumaki17]. Hiltonol® is synthetic double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid reported to protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV challenge when administered intranasally prior to infection[^Kumaki17]. Tilorone is a small molecule reported to inhibit MERS-CoV and other viruses _in vitro_ by inducing interferon[^Shen19][^Ekins20].

__Cyclophilin inhibitors__: Cyclosporin and FK-506 are two immunosuppressive drugs commonly used to prevent rejection in transplant recipients. The discovery of these two compounds led to the identification of the family of cyclophilin host proteins that bind to cyclosporin and FK-506. Cyclophilins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including protein folding, protein trafficking, and cell signaling. They have also been shown to play a role in the replication of several viruses including HIV-1, hepatitis C, influenza, and several coronavirus species[^deWilde18]. Alisporivir is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor which has been studied primarily for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. However, these compounds have generally had just weak inhibitory effects of on coronavirus replication and alisporivir did not protect mice from SARS-CoV infection[^deWilde11][^deWilde13][^deWilde17][^Carbajo-Lozoya14][^Li18][^Jeon20].

__Ivermectin__: Ivermectin is one of an increasing number of additional compounds found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 without a defined mechanism of action. It has a reported EC<sub>50</sub> of about 2 μM[^Caly20]. However, its plasma levels following oral administration appear too low to inhibit coronavirus replication [^Chaccour20][^Arshad20][^Schmith20]. In one retrospective study, ivermectin use was associated with significantly reduced mortality compared to persons at the same hospitals not receiving ivermectin, particularly in patients with severe pulmonary disease[^Rajter20]. As of July, ivermectin is being studied in 19 ongoing and 18 planned clinical trials.

### Uncertain Mechanisms of Action
__Ciclesonide__: Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid discovered in a high-throughput drug screen to inhibit coronavirus replication in the low μM range[^Matsuyama20][^Jeon20][^Ko20]. Although its mechanism of action is not known, MERS-CoV-2 passage passage in the presence of ciclesonide led to the selection of a point mutation in the nsp15 gene while multiple SARS-CoV-2 passage experiments led to consistent mutations in nsp3 (N1543K, G1763S, and D1764A)) and nsp4 (E230K) each of which reduced ciclesonide susceptibility. The mutated part of ns3 and ns4 are thought to be associated with double membrane formation. A single mutation in this gene was responsible for ~100-fold reduced susceptibility. A small case series of three patients from Japan who received inhaled ciclesonide has been published[^Iwabuchi20], As of August 25, there are two ongoing and six planned studies of inhaled ciclesonide.

__Nitazoxanide__: Nitazoxanide is licensed for the treatment of cryptosporidium infections. It has been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses in vitro. It has been proposed to interfere with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication including those involving interferon or mTORC1[^Rossignol16]. In one study its EC<sub>50</sub> for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.1 μM[^Wang20]. One pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that nitazoxanide plasma levels could reach concentrations above its one reported EC<sub>50</sub> level[^Arshad20]. As of July, it is being studied in five ongoing and nine planned clinical trials.

__Emetine__: Emetine is an FDA-approved drug for treating amebiasis. It is produced from the ipecac root and has been used to induce vomiting. Emetine has been shown in four studies to inhibit multiple coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 _in vitro_, with EC<sub>50</sub>s consistently below 1.0 μM[^Dyall14][^Shen19][^Ko20][^Choy20]. Its mechanism of action is not known for certain, although it did inhibit MERS-CoV in an entry inhibitor assay using a pseudotype virus expressing S protein[^Shen19]. After oral administration, its levels in the lungs are much higher than in the plasma and well above its reported EC<sub>50</sub> levels[^Bleasel20]. Emetine is currently not being studied for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2
