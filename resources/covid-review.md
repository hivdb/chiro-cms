## Polymerase Inhibitors
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. RdRps are highly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families [^10.3390/v11080745]. Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors are the most common antiviral compounds making up a plurality of all licensed antivirals. Most antiviral polymerase inhibitors lack a 3’-hydroxyl group and act as nucleoside analog chain terminators. Others contain a 3'-hydroxyl group yet still result in immediate or delayed chain termination. Finally, some nucleoside analogs become incorporated into viral genomes and inhibit replication by introducing mutations during subsequent rounds of virus replication.

Coronavirus RNA polymerization is more complex than that of other viruses. First, coronaviruses contain a 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN; nsp14) which is required for replication fidelity [^10.1073/pnas.0508200103]. ExoN is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of coronavirus species to ribavirin and several other nucleoside analogs [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1003565][^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. Second, coronavirus genomes are three times larger than most other RNA genomes and thus require increased processivity which may explain the RdRp (nsp12) requirement for two accessory proteins (nsp7 and nsp8).  Third, the coronavirus RdRp is required for transcribing multiple sub-genomic mRNAs in addition to copying the full virus genome. Several cryo-EM structures of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex of SARS-CoV-2 have been published [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.034][^10.1126/science.abb7498][^10.1038/s41586-020-2368-8][^10.1126/science.abc1560].

### Remdesivir
Remdesivir (GS-5734, Veklury) is the monophosphate prodrug of the parent 1’-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analogue GS-441524 [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01594]. The presence of the phosphate group allows for more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active nucleoside triphosphate form bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step. Remdesivir is a non-obligate chain terminator in that it contains a 3’-OH group. It causes delayed chain termination due to a steric clash with S861 after the addition of three trailing nucleosides [^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056][^10.1074/jbc.RA120.013679][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.015720]. The fact that chain termination does not occur until additional nucleoside triphosphates have been added explains the mechanism by which remdesivir eludes the coronavirus exonuclease.

Remdesivir has broad spectrum activity against multiple RNA viruses and inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>s) generally below 1 μM [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883][^10.1128/mBio.00221-18][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0]. Remdesivir inhibits coronaviruses in multiple cell types including primary human airway epithelial cells [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940]. Remdesivir reduces lung virus levels and lung damage in mice infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], and mice and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1038/s41586-020-2423-5].

Remdesivir is administered intravenously with a loading dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily for 5 to 10 days in adult patients. Following intravenous administration, the achievable maximum remdesivir plasma concentration is predicted to be at least twice as high as its most commonly reported EC<sub>50</sub>s. However, several research groups have argued that remdesivir penetrates poorly into the lungs [^10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173634][^10.1208/s12248-020-00459-8] and that there are likely to be more efficacious GS-441524 prodrugs [^10.31219/osf.io/mnhxu][^10.1101/2020.08.26.269159]. Remdesivir resistance has been selected in a related coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), during prolonged in vitro passage experiments [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18]. The remdesivir-resistant mutations are in the RdRp fingers domain. Introducing the homologous substitutions into SARS-CoV (F480L + V557L) resulted in a virus with reduced replication and about 6-fold reduced remdesivir susceptibility [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18].


As of December 2020, there have been five completed randomized controlled trials of remdesivir [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1056/NEJMoa2015301][^10.1001/jama.2020.16349][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. Two were blinded [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9] and four had a placebo control [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9][^10.1001/jama.2020.16349][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184]. The NIH Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) led to remdesivir’s FDA Emergency Use Authorization and subsequent approval blinded (Beigel et al. 2020)[^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. It was a multicenter trial that randomized 1063 persons with severe disease to remdesivir for 10 days versus placebo. Persons receiving remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days vs 15 days for the placebo group (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12-1.49; p<0.001). Kaplan Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% vs. 15.2% at day 29 (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.52-1.03). A subgroup analysis showed that response to therapy was greater in those with less severe disease (i.e., those not requiring supplemental oxygen or receiving oxygen via nasal cannula) than in those with severe disease (i.e., those requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation).


The open-label WHO Solidarity trial which included 2750 persons randomized to remdesivir and 4800 to standard-of-care detected no reduction in mortality, requirement for ventilation, or reduction in hospital stay for those receiving remdesivir [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184].  In addition, remdesivir was not associated with reductions in either upper or lower respiratory tract virus load levels in the one study that examined this outcome [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9].

Two randomized open-label studies that compared the use of 10 days vs. 5 days of remdesivir for persons with severe [^10.1056/NEJMoa2015301] and moderate [^10.1001/jama.2020.16349] disease found no difference between the two courses of therapy. A phase I study of an inhaled nanoparticle remdesivir formulation has begun (NCT0448033).

### MK-4482 (Molnupiravir, EIDD-2801)
β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a cytidine analogue that exerts its activity primarily through viral mutagenesis. It incorporates into new RNA strands which results in the introduction of large numbers of mutations errors during subsequent rounds of replication [^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (MK-4482 previously known as EIDD-2801) is an orally available NHC prodrug. The fact that MK-4482 is not a chain terminator likely explains the mechanism by which it eludes the proof-reading function of coronavirus exonucleases. Deep sequencing studies have confirmed that viral mutagenesis is the main mechanism by which MK-4482 inhibits coronaviruses [^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].

MK-4482 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1 μM [^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. It has activity in primary human airway epithelial cells. It reduces virus levels, disease, and lung damage in mouse models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al. 2020)[^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883] and in ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1038/s41564-020-00835-2]. A phase I dose-ranging study of a 5-day course of oral therapy in healthy adults found no evidence of toxicity compared with a placebo group and detected levels that were expected to be efficacious based on animal model studies (NCT04392219) [^10.1101/2020.12.10.20235747]. Two large phase II/III trials in hospitalized (NCT04575584) and nonhospitalized (NCT04575597) patients began in October 2020. MK-4482 is not being studied in pregnant women or women who might become pregnant because mutagenicity has been observed in bacterial studies [^10.1128/AAC.01652-20].

### Other Nucleoside Analogs
Ribavirin has demonstrated little, if any, in vitro or in vivo activity against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.virol.2009.09.023][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343][^10.1038/srep01686]. Although ribavirin 5’-monophosphate can be incorporated during RNA synthesis, it is readily excised by the coronavirus exonuclease [^10.1073/pnas.1718806115].

Favipiravir (T-705) is a purine analog prodrug that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form the active metabolite ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (aka T-705-RTP). It has broad spectrum activity against multiple viral RNA polymerases and appears to act by causing viral mutagenesis [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.015][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.03.003][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1002/cpt.1844]. However, it demonstrates little inhibitory activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 60 to >100 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7]. It displays activity in a hamster model but only when used at high doses [^10.1073/pnas.2014441117][^10.1101/2020.07.07.191775].  Several small open-label randomized studies have demonstrated little or no clinical or virological benefit associated with its use [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.142][^10.1128/AAC.01897-20][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1176][^10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105631].

The FDA-approved anti-hepatitis C nucleotide analog sofosbuvir is being studied in several COVID-19 clinical trials. Although it has reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical studies [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104857][^10.1038/s41598-020-73641-9][^10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00392], it has demonstrated little or no inhibitory activity in cell culture [^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411]. One small randomized open-label study of hospitalized adults suggested that the combination of sofosbuvir and daclastavir (which has greater in vitro inhibitory activity than sofosbuvir [^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411]) decreased the duration of hospitalization from 8 to 6 days [^10.1093/jac/dkaa334].

AT-527 is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug of AT-511, previously studied for the treatment of HCV, which has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [^10.1371/journal.pone.0227104][^10.1101/2020.08.11.242834]. It is being evaluated in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease.

## Protease Inhibitors
Coronaviruses contain two protease enzymes: 3 chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro or Main \[M\]pro; non-structural protein 5 \[nsp5\]) and papain-like serine protease (PLpro; nsp3). Mpro cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at 11 sites. It is conserved among several families of RNA viruses and has similar cleavage site specificity to the picornavirus family of 3C proteases. Mpro contains 306 amino acids and functions as a homodimer. It shares 96% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV Mpro. PLpro is part of a multidomain transmembrane protein. It cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 boundaries and several host proteins important for innate immunity such as ubiquitin interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG-15). There have been several published three-dimensional structures of PLpro and more than 100 published 3CLpro structures [^10.1016/j.drudis.2020.12.005]. There are more candidate Mpro inhibitors than PLpro inhibitors because of this enzyme’s similarities to those of other virus species and because 3CLpro is smaller and less complicated making it better able to be produced in large quantities and crystallized.

### Mpro inhibitors
Mpro has a unique substrate preference (Leu-Gln  {Ser, Ala, Gly}) not shared by any known human protease suggesting the potential for increased antiviral selectivity. There have been many drug screens and structure-based designs targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that have identified compounds inhibiting SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 either biochemically and/or in cell culture with IC50s (biochemical) and cell EC<sub>50</sub>s (cell culture) usually ranging from about 0.01 to 1 μM. These compounds belong to several series of reversible and covalently binding irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitors, many of which have been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [^10.1126/science.abb3405][^10.1126/science.abb4489][^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].

PF-00835231 may be the most potent investigational Mpro inhibitor. It inhibits Mpro biochemically with an IC50 of 0.0003 μM and in cell culture with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01063][^10.1101/2020.08.28.272880]. It has undergone safety studies and pharmacokinetic profiling in rats, dogs, and monkeys [^10.1101/2020.09.12.293498]. PF-07304814 is an intravenously administered phosphate PF-00835231 prodrug which is being studied in a phase I trial of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease (NCT04535167).

Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activity that has been studied for the treatment of a wide variety of illnesses. It was found to inhibit Mpro in a high-throughput drug screen and to have inhibitory activity in biochemical and cell culture assays of about 1 μM [^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y]. It appears to inhibit Mpro allosterically [^10.1126/sciadv.abd0345] and to also inhibit PLpro [^10.1101/2020.08.30.273979]. It is being studied as an oral drug in two phase II placebo-controlled trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and severe disease.

GC376 has been effectively used for treating cats with the rapidly fatal coronavirus disease FIPV [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1005531].  It forms covalent bonds with the Mpro active site cysteine and inhibits multiple coronaviruses [^10.1128/JVI.01348-12]. Its SARS-CoV-2 Mpro IC50 ranges from 0.03 to 1.5 μM while its cell culture EC<sub>50</sub> ranges from 0.2 to 3.4 μM [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-18096-2][^10.1101/2020.06.07.138677][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x]. GC376 is considered a promising lead compound for further development [^10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.004][^10.1101/2020.08.03.235291][^10.1126/sciadv.abe0751].

The approved HCV protease inhibitor boceprevir displays inhibits Mpro biochemically and in cell culture and is also considered a promising lead compound [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00521][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x]

### PLpro inhibitors
PLpro has been more challenge to study in vitro because it is a multidomain membrane-associated protein and not homologous to other viral proteases. Nonetheless, several crystal structures have been published [^10.1101/2020.08.06.240192][^10.1126/sciadv.abd4596][^10.1016/j.apsb.2020.08.014] and several lead compounds with sub-micromolar activity have been reported including thioguanine and several ebselen derivatives [^10.15252/embj.2020106275][^10.1101/2020.07.01.183020].

### HIV-1 protease inhibitors
Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (lopinavir/r) was used to treat COVID-19 primarily based on anecdotal reports of efficacy at treating SARS-CoV in 2003 [^10.1136/thorax.2003.012658][^PMID14660806]. However, lopinavir displays little or no in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s between 5 and >25 μM and displays a low selectivity index [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.04.06.026476][^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z]. Lopinavir/r has lacked protective activity in mice-infected with MERS-CoV [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6] and ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/mBio.01114-20]. Finally, in two open label randomized controlled trials of lopinavir/r compared with standard-of-care in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2, no virological or clinical benefit was observed [^10.1056/NEJMoa2001282][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184]. The combination of lopinavir/r plus interferon- also yielded no clinical benefit in a placebo-controlled trial of patients with MERS [^10.1056/NEJMoa2015294].

The HIV-1 protease inhibitors nelfinavir and atazanavir have demonstrated variable but generally weak in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from below 1 to >50 μM [^10.1101/2020.04.06.026476][^10.1101/2020.06.16.153403][^10.1101/2020.04.14.039925][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1128/AAC.00825-20] while darunavir has displayed no inhibitory activity [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.085][^10.1101/2020.04.06.026476].

## Entry Inhibitors
Coronavirus cell entry is mediated by the spike (S) glycoprotein. S is a membrane protein essential for the two main steps of the entry process: attachment to the host cell and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. S is a trimer comprising three identical subunits. Each S monomer has an exposed attachment domain called S1 and a partially hidden fusion domain called S2. Part of S1, the receptor binding domain (RBD), sporadically alternates between a closed/down position and an open/up position enabling it to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1126/science.abb2507]. S1 binding occurs on the outer surface of ACE2 whereas angiotensin substrates bind in a deep cleft containing the active site [^10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045][^10.1038/s41586-020-2179-y][^33277323]. After an RBD binds ACE2, structural changes occur that lead to S1 dissolution, S2 exposure, and the opportunity for virus-cell fusion.

S has two cleavage sites. One is at the S1/S2 boundary and the other is at a site within S2 referred to as S2’. These sites must be cleaved by host proteases to enable S1 and S2 to undergo the conformational changes required to shift from receptor binding to cell fusion [^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. The specific cleavage sites, the responsible host enzymes, and the cellular locations where cleavage occurs vary among different coronaviruses and likely also in different cell types. This variation is believed to play a role in cellular tropism and pathogenesis [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. In contrast, to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which is cleaved during biosynthesis [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104742]. It has been speculated that the presence of this cleavage site may have expanded the transmissibility and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 considering the more widespread expression of furin-like proteases in host cells.

S2 contains two complementary heptad repeat (HR) regions, designated HR1 and HR2, which are alpha helices with repeated patterns of seven amino acids. HR1 and HR2 have complementary regions allowing them to bind to each other. HR1 projects out to the host cell membrane whereas HR2 is about 170 amino acids upstream and closer to the virus membrane [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. During fusion HR1 and HR2 bind to each other creating a hairpin that brings the viral and cell membranes together.

This section describes interventions that interfere with virus entry including mAbs single-domain Abs (sdAbs), polyclonal Ab preparations, fusion inhibitors, ACE2-mimicking compounds, and cellular attachment inhibitors. Compounds that inhibit the host protease enzymes required for cleaving the S protein are described in the section on host-acting compounds.

### Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)
Neutralizing mAbs are effective at preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [^10.1542/peds.2009-2345][^10.1007/s12519-010-0230-z] and treating Ebola virus infection [^10.1056/NEJMoa1910993]. They have also demonstrated potential for treating other acute viral infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza [^10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104562]. Convalescent plasma appears to offer some protection against severe COVID-19 when it contains high titers of neutralizing Abs and is administered soon after symptoms develop [^10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359][^10.1101/2020.11.20.20234013]. Finally, the development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Abs following infection and vaccination correlate with protection in NHP models [^10.1126/science.abc4776][^10.1126/science.abc6284][^10.1038/s41586-020-03041-6].

The role of neutralizing Abs in the recovery from SARS-CoV-2, however, is complicated because the highest neutralizing Abs levels are consistently detected in patients experiencing severe illness [^10.1038/s41591-020-0897-1][^10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9][^10.1371/journal.pone.0236905][^10.1093/cid/ciaa344]. Neutralizing Abs therefore may play a protective role in patients for whom more rapid immunologic responses to infection fail to prevent severe disease [^10.1038/s41577-020-0359-5][^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1101/2020.12.18.20248331]. The most common neutralizing Abs emerging in patients target the S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) [^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1126/sciimmunol.abc8413][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.037][^10.1101/2020.08.21.261727].

More than 60 studies have reported the isolation of mAbs (https://covdb.stanford.edu/page/mab-tables/). Most have described standard mAbs comprising two heavy and light chains.  About 15 studies have described single-domain Abs (sdAbs; aka nanobodies). mAbs are initially characterized according to their method of isolation, their genetic sequence, their epitopes, and their in vitro neutralization potency. mAbs considered for clinical use are also often characterized by their activity against common circulating virus variants, selection for resistant variants, Fc-dependent effector function including antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and activity in animal models.

More than 15 mAbs are being studied in clinical trials, including five that have begun phase III trials. Two mAbs have reported preliminary results and received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of high-risk outpatients [^10.1101/2020.09.30.318972][^10.1126/science.abd0827][^10.1126/science.abd0831][^10.1126/science.abe2402][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002][^10.1056/NEJMoa2029849].

#### mAb Isolation
Standard neutralizing mAbs have been isolated from the memory B cells of persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2, Ab-producing cells from immunized transgenic mice, and combinatorial phage display libraries. Regardless of their source, Ab-producing cells must be filtered for their ability to bind the S trimer or just the RBD and the mAb’s heavy and light chain Ig regions must be cloned. Combinatorial libraries can be used as a stand-alone platform for mAb isolation or to facilitate the isolation of mAbs from other sources.

Isolating mAbs from memory B cells involves memory B cell stimulation, screening cell supernatants for trimeric S or RBD-binding Abs, and B cell sorting followed by Ab cloning. Microfluidic advances have made it possible to clone and sequence paired light and heavy chains from thousands of memory B cells expressing S or RBD-binding Abs. Studies differ in the number of donors from whom B cells are obtained, the number of mAbs that are cloned and sequenced, and the number of mAbs characterized in vitro.

S-binding mAbs are evaluated for their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in pseudovirus and/or infectious virus assays because the strength of mAb-S binding is not a reliable indicator of neutralization [^10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9][^10.1126/science.abc7520]. Pseudoviruses are engineered viruses (usually vesicular stomatitis virus or HIV-1) that contain a reporter gene and display the SARS-CoV-2 S protein on their surface. Pseudovirus assay results usually correlate with those of infectious virus assays, although they may occasionally exaggerate an mAb’s in vitro potency. Therefore, infectious virus assay results are more reliable indicators of in vivo activity. Neutralizing mAb activity are reported as EC<sub>50</sub>s or IC50s in either g/ml or ng/ml. As standard mAbs have a molecular weight of 150 kDa, an EC<sub>50</sub> of 150 ng/ml is equivalent to one nanomolar. The most potent SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have EC<sub>50</sub>s between 1 to 15 ng/ml.

#### mAb Sequences
mAb sequencing is increasingly used to prioritize neutralizing mAb studies. First, clonal sequences from expanded memory B cell populations are more likely to possess neutralizing activity. Second, the sequence of an mAb can indicate whether it possesses biophysical properties amenable to large scale production [^10.1073/pnas.1810576116]. The heavy chain of each Fab comprises variable, joining, and diversity segments while the light chain comprises variable and joining segments. Ig sequences are classified according to the closest germ line genes encoding their heavy and light chain joining and variable segments and their extent of affinity maturation. Each chain contains three variable regions referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. The heavy chain CDR3 is the most variable region reflecting its diversity gene segment and the junctional diversity arising during Ab gene rearrangement.

There have been two main observations about SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb sequences. First, a high proportion are encoded by the V3-53 or highly similar V3-66 heavy chain gene segment [^10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9][^10.1126/science.abc7520][^10.1126/science.abc5902][^10.1016/j.immuni.2020.06.001][^10.1038/s41586-020-2571-7][^10.1038/s41467-020-18159-4][^10.1126/science.abc2241][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.025]. Neutralizing mAbs encoded by these gene segments generally bind to a high proportion of the RBD’s ACE2-binding amino acids. Second, nearly all mAbs display little affinity maturation with usually fewer than 5% of the approximately one hundred amino acids in the Ig heavy and light chain variable regions containing differences from their putative germ-line gene sequence. This may be partly related to the fact that most mAbs from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients have been identified within two months from infection. Levels of affinity maturation up to 10% were reported in one study in which mAbs were isolated from persons six months following infection [^10.1101/2020.11.03.367391].

#### Structural studies
X-ray crystallography has been used to determine the structure of the S RBD bound to an mAb’s Fab while cryo-EM has been used to determine the structure of the complete S trimer bound to an mAb’s Fab. These two approaches have made it possible to determine the precise S residues to which an mAb binds. Other biophysical methods such as biolayer interferometry, surface plasmon resonance, and negative-staining EM have been used to determine the general area within the RBD to provide a less precise picture of an mAb’s epitope. Structural information has also been obtained from competition ELISA assays, for example, to determine whether an mAb competes with ACE2 for RBD binding or with another mAb.

Neutralizing mAbs are classified as ACE2-competing or non-ACE2-competing. ACE2-competing mAbs bind to a part of the RBD referred to as the receptor-binding motif (RBM), whereas non-ACE2-competing mAbs bind a part of the RBD referred as the RBD core. The RBD core is more evolutionarily conserved than the ACE2-binding residues in the RBM. mAbs that bind this region can often neutralize SARS-CoV and other SARS-related coronaviruses [^10.1038/s41467-020-16256-y][^10.1126/science.abb7269][^10.1038/s41594-020-0480-y][^10.1126/science.abc7424][^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. However, non-ACE2-competing are usually somewhat less inhibitory than ACE2-competing mAbs. Two groups have described potent mAbs that recognize the S1 N-terminal domain rather than the RBD [^10.1126/science.abc6952][^10.1038/s41586-020-2571-7].

In addition to their epitopes, mAbs can be classified according to whether they bind RBD in its down/closed and/or its up/open position. Obtaining this information generally requires a structure that includes the complete S trimer. mAbs that can bind in both positions should be more inhibitory, but correlations between binding mode and in vitro neutralization have not been reported. Several mAb have been reported to simultaneously bind two RBDs.

Several correlations between mAb sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 epitope have been described. For example, according to one classification system, class 1 mAbs are encoded by VH3-53 gene segments with short CDRH3 loops that block ACE2 and bind only to open/up RBDs [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.025]. These mAbs can cross-link adjacent RBDs within a single trimer. Class 2 mAbs are ACE2-blocking mAbs that bind both open/up and closed/down RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.025]. Class 2 mAbs can also be encoded by VH3-53. Class 3 mAbs bind the RBD core and can recognize both up and down RBDs. There is one class 4 mAb, CR3022, which is non-ACE2-competing and can bind only to up RBDs.

#### Fc-effector functions
The ability of an mAb to prevent viral entry into target cells and inhibit virus replication in vitro is independent of its Fc-effector functions such as ADCC and ADCP. However, the action of mAbs against infected cells and protection against infection in vivo may depend on these functions [^10.1172/JCI84428][^10.1038/s41590-018-0233-9][^10.1084/jem.20201993][^10.1038/nri.2017.148]. Nonetheless, it is uncertain how to predict which neutralizing mAbs will elicit ADCC and ADCP because Fc-mediated functions depend on the stoichiometry of binding, binding orientations relative to FcR receptors, and to subtle Fc characteristics [^10.1084/jem.20201993][^10.1038/s41590-020-00828-7].

Two groups performed cell culture assays to assess the effects of mAbs on ADCC and ADCP [^10.1126/science.abd0827][^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. Conversely, other groups modified their mAbs to reduce FcR receptor engagement by introducing the Fc mutations L234A and L235A with the objectives of prolonging Ab half-life and reducing potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection or disease [^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y][^10.1101/2020.09.27.316174][^10.1038/s41467-020-19568-1]. Each of these modified mAbs appeared to retain their activity in animal models [^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y][^10.1101/2020.09.27.316174][^10.1038/s41467-020-19568-1].

#### Animal models
mAbs have been studied _in vivo_ primarily in rhesus macaques[^10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6][^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y][^10.1101/2020.09.30.318972][^10.1126/science.abe2402][^10.1038/s41467-020-19568-1], Syrian hamsters [^10.1101/2020.09.27.316174][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.049][^10.1126/science.abc7520][^10.1126/science.abe3354][^10.1101/2020.10.26.355107][^10.1101/2020.10.28.359836][^10.1101/2020.08.24.264630][^10.1073/pnas.2010197117], and Balb/c [^10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6][^10.1084/jem.20201993][^10.1101/2020.09.23.309294][^10.1073/pnas.2010197117] or hACE2-expressing transgenic mice [^10.4049/jimmunol.2000583][^10.1101/2020.10.26.355107][^10.1126/science.abc2241][^10.1073/pnas.2010197117][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.025][^10.1126/science.abc5881][^10.1101/2020.10.26.354811]. Rhesus macaques experience similar levels of virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and develop pathological features of viral pneumonia but exhibit less severe clinical signs and symptoms compared with severely affected humans [^10.1038/s41586-020-2787-6]. Syrian hamsters exhibit high levels of respiratory tract viral replication and pathological changes, as well as more severe clinical disease including respiratory distress and weight loss [^10.1038/s41586-020-2787-6]. Various mouse models using genetically modified mice and/or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains have also been useful because mice exhibit respiratory tract viral replication and weight loss.

In animal model experiments, mAbs are generally administered parenterally or intraperitoneally 12 hours before or after infection with an inoculum of about 10,000 to 100,000 tissue culture infectious doses. With few exceptions, such as the use of the lowest in a series of mAb dosages or the delayed administration of an mAb beyond 12 hours, nearly all mAbs lead to marked reductions in virus replication and lung pathology regardless of the animal model and lead to reduced weight loss in Syrian hamsters and mice. There has been no evidence for worsening of disease as might be seen with ADE in any of these models.

#### Clinical trials
There are currently five mAb preparations being studied in phase 3 clinical trials and 12 in ongoing or planned phase 1, 2, or 3 trials. Preliminary data from two phase 2 trials for the mAb LY-CoV555 (aka LY3819253; bamlanivimab) and for the mAb combination REGN10933 (casirivimab) + REGN10987 (imdevimab) have been published [^10.1056/NEJMoa2029849][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002]. Both LY-CoV555 and REGN10933/REGN10987 have received FDA EUA approval for use in high-risk outpatients.

LY-CoV555 is an ACE2-competing mAb reported to bind RBD in its up and down configurations and to reduce upper and lower airway virus levels in rhesus macaques [^10.1101/2020.09.30.318972]. An interim analysis of the randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 BLAZE-1 trial studied LY-CoV555 as a single intravenous infusion in outpatients with a SatO2 >93% within three days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 virologic test. Among 452 participants randomized to receive 700 mg, 2800 mg, or 7000 mg of LY-CoV555 or placebo, the mean decrease in nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 level from baseline to Day 11 (the primary endpoint) was significantly greater than placebo among those who received the 2800 mg dose but not the 700 mg or 7000 mg doses. In the placebo group, 6.3% (9/143) of participants required hospitalization or an ER visit compared with 1.6% (5/309) of participants in the pooled treatment groups. In a post hoc analysis of high-risk patients, 14.6% (7/48) in the control group vs. 4.2% (4/95) in the pooled treatment groups required hospitalization or an ER visit. Based on these data, the FDA EUA allowed for the use of LY-CoV555 700 mg IV for the treatment of high risk nonhospitalized adults and children 12 and weighing 40 kg.

The ACTIV3 trial substudy, which randomized hospitalized patients to remdesivir with or without LY-CoV555 was discontinued due to a lack of clinical benefit (https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/statement-on-bamlanivimab-eua/). LY-CoV555 is also being studied in a phase 3 trial to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing home residents and staff (NCT04497987); a phase 2 trial (NCT04634409) with or without LY-CoV16 (aka LY3832479; JS016; CB6) in recently diagnosed outpatients with mild-to-moderate disease; additional phase 2 and 3 trials of outpatients with mild-moderate disease (NCT04518410) and a phase 4 trial (NCT04656691). LY-CoV16 is an ACE2-competing neutralizing mAb derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent memory B cells, which has been shown to reduce virus levels and lung pathology when administered one day before or after infection of rhesus macaques [^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y]. Its Fc receptor has been mutated to prolong its half-life.

REGN10933/REGN10987 are ACE-2 competing mAbs that bind to non-overlapping RBD epitopes. Their sequences and structural data have been published [^10.1126/science.abd0827]. They have been reported to elicit ADCC and ADCP _in vitro_, to reduce virus levels and prevent weight loss in hamsters, and to prevent lung pathology in rhesus macaques [^10.1126/science.abd0827][^10.1126/science.abd0831][^10.1126/science.abe2402]. The randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 R10933-10987-COV-2067 trial studied the use of a single intravenous REGN10933/REGN10987 infusion in outpatients with a median symptom duration of three days. 799 participants were randomized to receive either 2400 mg or 8000 mg of the mAb combination; 34% were considered at high risk for disease progression. Among participants with detectable baseline virus, the time-weighted average change in nasopharyngeal level from baseline to day 7 was significantly greater among those receiving either the 2400 mg or 8000 mg dose compared with placebo (-0.36 log10 copies/mL; p<0.0001).

In the placebo group, 4.3% (10/231) required hospitalization or ER visit compared with 1.8% (8/434) in the pooled REGN10933/REGN10987 treatment groups. In a post-hoc analysis of high-risk participants, 9.0% (7/78) in the placebo group required hospitalization or ER visit compared with 2.6% (4/151) in the pooled treatment groups. There was no discernable difference between the two mAb dosage regimens. The median time to symptom improvement was 5 days in the treatment group and 6 days in the placebo group. The safety profile of the mAb combination at both the low and the high dose was reportedly similar to that of the placebo. A trial of REGN10933/REGN10987 in hospitalized patients was modified to discontinue enrollment of patients requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation because an interim analysis revealed no likelihood of clinical benefit in this population. The FDA EUA allows for the use of REGN10933/REGN10987 (2800 mg IV) for the treatment of nonhospitalized high risk adults and children 12 and weighting 40 kg (). REGN10933/REGN10987 is also being studied as a subcutaneous injection in a phase 3 trial for the prevention of infection in healthy household contacts of persons with active infection (NCT04452318).

VIR-7831 (Sotrovimab; GSK4182136) is based on the neutralizing mAb S309, which was isolated from SARS-CoV-1 convalescent memory B cells [^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. Its sequence and structural data have been published. It is a non-ACE2-competing mAb that binds to the RBD core region and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV-1. It binds to RBD in its down/closed and up/open configurations. It has been reported to elicit ADCC and ADCP in vitro and it has undergone Fc modifications to prolong its half-life [^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. It is being studied in a phase II/III trial of high-risk outpatients that began in September (NCT04545060).

AZD7442 (AZD8895/Tixagevimab + AZD1061/Cilgavimab) is an mAb combination based on the mAbs COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 [^10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6][^10.1038/s41591-020-0998-x], which are ACE2-competing mAbs that bind nonoverlapping epitopes. COV2-2196 binds RBD in the up configuration; COV2-2130 binds RBD in the up and down configuration. Each mAb reduces weight loss and lung virus levels in a mouse prevention model. COV2-2196 reduces lung virus levels in rhesus macaques. Since November, AZD7442 has been studied in phase III trials of post-exposure prophylaxis (NCT04625972) and passive immunization (NCT04625725).

CT-P59 (Regdanvimab) is an ACE2-competing mAb that reduces virus replication in hamsters and rhesus macaques [^10.21203/rs.3.rs-59639/v1]. Its sequence and structural data are publicly available. It is being studied in a phase 2/3 placebo-controlled trial in outpatients with mild-to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection (NCT04602000).

#### Drug resistance
Three approaches have been used to assess an mAb’s vulnerability to drug resistance. First, circulating spike variants have been examined for those containing mutations within an mAb’s epitope thus potentially interfering with its inhibitory activity [^10.1126/science.abd0831][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.012][^10.1016/j.chom.2021.01.014]. These mutations can then be assessed in a pseudovirus assay for their effects on mAb susceptibility. Second, in vitro passage experiments have been performed using pseudoviruses (which mutate at higher rates than SARS-CoV-2) to identify mutations arising under mAb selection pressure [^10.1126/science.abd0831][^10.7554/eLife.61312]. Third, comprehensive libraries of RBD variants have been created and screened for their functionality and effects on mAb binding to identify mutations requiring further study [^32841599][^10.1101/2020.11.30.405472][^10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.007].

These approaches have led to the identification of 90 mutations at about 45 positions associated with >10-fold reduced susceptibility to one or more mAbs and in some cases to convalescent plasma. Among the mAbs in clinical trials, only the REGN mAbs have been studied for the development of resistance [^10.1126/science.abd0831][^32841599]. Most of the reported escape mutations have reduced susceptibility to mAbs that are currently not in clinical trials. Among the 45 positions at which mutations with reduced susceptibility have been reported, 15 are ACE-2 binding residues, about 20 are non-ACE2 receptor binding motif mutations, and about 10 mutations are in the RBD core. Most mAb-resistance mutations occur within mAb epitopes. An increasing number of mAb resistance mutations have now been reported to occur at a prevalence 0.1% including N439K, G446V, Y453F, S477N, and N501Y.

### Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs)
sdAbs are heavy chain only Abs also referred to as VHHs and nanobodies. They were first detected in camelids and are the smallest naturally derived antigen-binding functional fragments [^10.3389/fimmu.2017.01802]. Sybodies are synthetic human sdAbs generated by VHH fragment libraries. Owing to being single polypeptides, sdAbs can be relatively efficiently produced in bacteria and yeast, and their inherent stability enables aerosolized delivery to nasal or lung epithelium [^10.3389/fimmu.2017.01802]. They can also be engineered to be dimeric or trimeric or linked to an Fc fragment. Many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing sdAbs have been isolated [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.031][^10.1126/science.abe3255][^10.1038/s41467-020-19204-y][^10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5][^10.1038/s41589-020-00679-1][^10.1126/science.abe4747][^10.1038/s41594-020-0469-6][^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.023]. In their monomeric forms, they are generally less potent than conventional mAbs. However, several dimeric and trimeric sdAbs are highly potent in vitro [^10.1126/science.abe4747][^10.1126/science.abe3255]. sdAbs have not yet been studied in animal models or clinical trials.

### Polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations
A hyperimmune human immunoglobulin preparation is being evaluated in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease in a phase III placebo-controlled NIH trial (NCT04546581). A purified Fab preparation derived from equine hyperimmune sera (INM005) is being studied in a phase II/III placebo-controlled trial (NCT04494984). A purified humanized SARS-CoV-2 IgG preparation derived from immunized genetically modified swine (XAV-19) is being studied in a phase II trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease [^10.1101/2020.07.25.217158]. A purified humanized SARS-CoV-2 IgG preparation derived from immunized transchromosomic cows (SAB-185) is being studied in phase I treatment (NCT04469179) and prevention (NCT04468958) trials.

### Fusion Inhibitors
Peptides that mimic HR2 can block virus-cell fusion by preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2. Several peptide mimics of coronavirus HR2 have been shown to potently inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.046][^10.1093/infdis/jiv325][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792][^10.1038/ncomms4067][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00890][^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580][^10.1128/JVI.00635-20]. Interest in coronavirus fusion inhibitors is partly motivated by the high level of S2 conservation. For example, SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV-2 S2 differ by more than 10% of their amino acids. However, their HR1 domains differ by 7% and their HR2 domains are essentially identical [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x].

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an HR2 mimicking peptide, EK1, was identified as a potential broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor as it inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at sub-micromolar levels and was found to safe and protective against MERS-CoV when administered intranasally to mice [^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580]. Based on SARS-CoV-2 structural studies, several EK1 amino acid modifications were made and a cholesterol group was added [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x] because lipidation has been shown to improve the pharmacokinetics and inhibitory activity of viral fusion inhibitors [^10.1128/JVI.00288-17]. This new lipopeptide, named EK1C4 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 fusion about 150 times more potently than EK1, resulting in an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.04 μM.

Several additional highly potent HR2-mimicking SARS-Cov-2 fusion inhibitors have been described including IPB02 and IPB04 [^10.1128/JVI.00635-20], HRC-lipoprotein-SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/mBio.01935-20], and the dimeric lipoprotein \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol [^10.1101/2020.11.04.361154]. Intranasal administration of \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol to ferrets completely protected them from infection while co-housed with other infected ferrets [^10.1101/2020.11.04.361154].

### Soluble ACE2 and other molecular decoys
The approximately 750 amino acid soluble recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is safe in human subjects [^10.1007/s40262-013-0072-7] and protects lungs from injury during the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^10.1007/s00018-007-6228-6][^10.1038/nm1267][^10.1186/s13054-017-1823-x][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004]. Even prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rhACE2 was being developed as an ARDS treatment. rhACE2 inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.114][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045] and also appears to prevent the loss of lung protective effects that is associated with the internalization of ACE2 following SARS-CoV-2 binding

Several research groups have shown that rhACE2 and proteins designed to mimic the ACE2 ectodomain are highly potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in cell culture and in pseudovirus entry experiments. Several strategies have been employed to create ACE2 mimics more potent and/or smaller than the natural ACE2 ectodomain by identifying just those ACE2 regions that contribute most strongly to RBD binding [^10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.029][^10.1126/science.abe0075][^10.1126/science.abd9909][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117]. ACE2 mimics have also been fused to Ig Fc domains and to scaffolds to create bivalent or trivalent inhibitors [^10.1101/2020.10.18.344622][^10.1038/s41467-020-16048-4][^10.1101/2020.09.18.301952][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117].

CTC-445.2d is a dimeric ACE2 mimic that has been shown to protect hamsters from weight loss and death [^10.1126/science.abe0075]. APN1 (Apeiron Biologics), a clinical grade soluble rhACE2 [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004] that has demonstrated safety in 89 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients and volunteers and is now being evaluated in a 200-person placebo-controlled study of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients (NCT04335136). Although ACE2 mimics cannot recruit immune cells, they can be potentially bind to SARS-CoV-2 as tightly as mAbs and can be easier to manufacture as they do not require expression in mammalian cells.

### Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) attachment inhibitors
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells and serve as attachment sites for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses [^10.1371/journal.pone.0023710][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.033][^10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106118]. Several compounds that inhibit the interaction between viruses and HSPGs have antiviral activity including lactoferrin and certain anticoagulants. Lactoferrin is a mammalian antimicrobial protein found in multiple secretory fluids and it has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [^10.1371/journal.pone.0023710][^10.1101/2020.05.27.117184]. It is available as an over-the- counter supplement and is being studied orally and intranasally for the treatment of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. The anticoagulants heparin, enoxaparin, and pixatimod bind interfere with virus cell entry by this mechanism by inhibiting the binding of RBD to HSPGs [^10.1128/JVI.01987-20][^10.1101/2020.06.24.169334][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104873][^10.1111/bph.15304][^10.1101/2020.04.28.066761]. Administration of heparin intranasally has been proposed as a method of preventing spread of SARS-CoV-2 after initial infection without increasing the risk of bleeding [^10.1128/JVI.01987-20]. Heparin and enoxaparin are being studied in clinical trials as both anticoagulants and potential attachment inhibitors.

### Miscellaneous entry Inhibitors
Umifenovir (arbidol) is an oral drug used in Russia and China to treat influenza and other viral infections [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.04.006][^10.1128/JVI.02077-15]. It is reported to have in vitro activity against multiple viruses and to inhibit viral entry by binding viral surface glycoproteins [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.10.009]. Its SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub>s have been between 5 and 10 μM with a selectivity index of about 8 [^10.1038/s41598-020-70143-6][^10.1038/s41421-020-0169-8][^10.3389/fimmu.2020.586572]. A crystal structure of umifenovir in complex with influenza hemagglutinin shows it binding a hydrophobic cavity in the hemagglutinin trimer stem [^10.1073/pnas.1617020114]. There have been two open-label controlled trials in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which have demonstrated lack of clinical efficacy [^10.1016/j.medj.2020.04.001][^10.1101/2020.03.17.20037432].

## Convalescent Plasma
There is a strong biological rationale for the use of passive immunotherapeutic approaches to treat viral infections. Immunoglobulin preparations have been FDA-approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, varicella, cytomegalovirus, and rabies infection [^10.7326/M20-6448]. Nonetheless, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been just one randomized control trial of convalescent plasma for the treatment of a viral infection [^10.1016/s0140-6736(79)92335-3], which demonstrated that convalescent plasma markedly reduced mortality in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever. A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven uncontrolled studies concluded that potential benefits were uncertain [^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343] while a larger, more recent meta-analysis of 32 studies of SARS-CoV and influenza, concluded that the administration of convalescent plasma early after symptom onset resulted in a significant 75% reduction in the pooled odds of mortality compared with placebo or no therapy [^10.1093/infdis/jiu396].

There has been one large observational trial and several open label and placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma. The large observational trial was an assessment of an expanded access program which was published as two manuscripts. The first was a safety review of the first 20,000 patients receiving convalescent plasma [^10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.028]. In this study, 71% were classified as having severe or life-threatening diseases and 29% were judged to be at high risk of progressing to severe or life-threatening disease. The risk of severe adverse events considered related to transfusion was about 0.5%. A follow-up expanded efficacy analysis of this population reported a 7-day mortality of 8.7% in patients transfused within 3 days of diagnosis compared with 11.9% in patients transfused after 3 days (p<0.001) [^10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359]. However, as the ability to receive early treatment is likely a major confounder of clinical outcome, the more important finding from this study was that the 7-day mortality was significantly reduced for those who received plasma with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers.

Among the published randomized trials of convalescent plasma, one was a placebo-controlled trial of non-ventilated patients with severe disease [^10.1056/NEJMoa2031304], another was a placebo controlled trial of high-risk patients with symptoms for less than 72 hours [^10.1101/2020.11.20.20234013], and four were open-label trials of patients with severe disease [^10.1136/bmj.m3939][^10.1101/2020.08.26.20182444][^10.1101/2020.07.01.20139857][^10.1001/jama.2020.10044]. In five of the six studies, the mean donor IgG titer was considered to be in the therapeutic range of >1:160 [^10.1056/NEJMoa2031304][^10.1101/2020.11.20.20234013][^10.1001/jama.2020.10044][^10.1101/2020.08.26.20182444][^10.1101/2020.07.01.20139857]. The placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe disease reported no difference in clinical status at day 30 for convalescent plasma recipients compared with the control group [^10.1056/NEJMoa2031304]. The second placebo-controlled trial, which was published as a preprint, reported that convalescent plasma significantly reduced the risk of severe respiratory disease (12% vs 30%; p=0.007) among high-risk patients with early disease [^10.1101/2020.11.20.20234013]. One of the four open-label studies reported a significantly reduced mortality (0% vs. 14%; p=0.03) for those receiving convalescent plasma [^10.1101/2020.08.26.20182444]. A second reported a significant clinical improvement associated with convalescent plasma for the subgroup of patients with severe but not critical disease [^10.1001/jama.2020.10044].

In conclusion, convalescent plasma may reduce the risk of severe illness when it contains sufficiently high IgG titers and is used in high-risk persons with early disease. Nonetheless, additional clinical trials performed early in disease using plasma units containing high titers of neutralizing antibodies are required.

## Interferons
In response to cellular changes suggestive of a viral infection, interferons (IFNs) inducing numerous IFN-stimulated genes encoding proteins that inhibit viral replication by slowing cellular metabolism, interfering with membrane formation required for virus replication, and inducing cytokines that promote adaptive immunity [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104791]. There are three IFN families [^10.1038/nri3787].  Type I IFNs includes 13 related IFN-α subtypes, IFN-β, and several poorly defined single gene products including IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω. Type II IFN consists of a single gene product IFN-γ. Type III IFN consists of IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3.

Several IFN-α preparations have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus, and several malignancies. IFN-β, IFN-γ, and IFN-λ have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, congenital immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease, and hepatitis delta infection, respectively. Commercial IFN-α preparations vary in the extent to which they include different IFN-α subtypes, although the biological and clinical significance of the differences between these preparations are not known [^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. Pegylated interferons have a longer half-life because the attached polyethylene glycol delays IFN clearance.

The importance of IFNs for combatting SARS-CoV-2 is underscored by the fact that many viruses, particularly coronaviruses encode multiple proteins that antagonize cellular IFN signaling pathways [^10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81][^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to encode about 10 proteins that allow virus to escape or counteract IFN induction or antiviral action [^10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1008737]. Supporting a role for IFNs in protection against SARS-CoV-2 is the finding that about 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 have neutralizing type I IFN autoantibodies [^10.1126/science.abd4585]. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a reduced IFN response in some studies [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.026][^10.1126/science.abc6027] and an increased response in other studies [^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.017]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to increase ACE2 expression in upper airway cells [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.035].

IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ each demonstrate inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations (100 to 1000 IU/ml) in Vero and Calu3 cell lines and in primary human alveolar cells (Lokugamage et al. 2020; Mantlo et al. 2020; Felgenhauer et al. 2020; Vanderheiden et al. 2020; Busnadiego et al.2020)[^10.1128/JVI.01410-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013788][^10.1128/JVI.00985-20][^10.1128/mBio.01928-20]. Two _in vitro_ studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to Type I IFNs than SARS-CoV possibly because of a deletion in ORF3b, a 154 amino acid protein known to antagonize one of the proteins involved in the IFN response (Lokugamage et al. 2020;  Felgenhauer et al. 2020)[^10.1128/JVI.01410-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013788][^10.1128/JVI.00985-20][^10.1128/mBio.01928-20]. IFN-α and IFN-β have demonstrated protective effects against SARS and MERS in mice [^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.11.007] and macaques [^10.1038/nm1001][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1000756][^10.1038/srep01686] models while IFN-λ has demonstrated protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 in one mouse model [^10.1038/s41586-020-2708-8]. However, three studies reported worse outcomes in mouse models of SARS and MERS with delayed administration of type I IFNs [^10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.007][^10.1172/JCI126363][^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6].

There has been one phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial of a nebulized IFN-β preparation SNG001 in non-ventilated hospitalized patients receiving supplementary oxygen [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7], two phase II randomized placebo-controlled trials of subcutaneous IFN-λ in outpatients with mild disease [^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161][^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098], two randomized open-label trials of IFN-β including the SOLIDARITY trial [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1128/AAC.01061-20], one open-label trial of IFN-α [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.053], and one open-label trial of IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4]. Nebulized IFN-β was found to be associated with an improved outcome as 6 of 48 patients in the IFN group vs. 11 of 51 patients in the placebo group developed severe disease or died [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7]. The larger of the two IFN-λ studies showed no virological benefit [^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161], whereas the smaller study reported lower virus loads at day 7 in a post-hoc adjusted analysis (Feld et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.11.18.20234161][^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098]. Among the open-label trials, the strongest signal of efficacy was a shorter time to viral clearance and more rapid clinical improvement in patients receiving IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4].

There is currently one ongoing phase III trial for inhaled SNG001 (IFN-β; EUCTR2020-004743-83-GB) and one planned study for inhaled Novaferon (IFN-α) in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (NCT04669015). Subcutaneous IFN-λ is being studied in a third phase II trial of outpatients (NCT04344600). The NIH treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of IFNs for the treatment of severely ill patients with COVID-19 but provide no recommendation for the use of IFNs in earlier disease.

## Host-Targeting Compounds
Repurposed drugs that have been approved or are being studied for other indications often target host processes that influence viral replication. Such compounds host-targeting compounds may be able to inhibit multiple viruses, since different viruses often depend on similar host factors and pathways. Although such compounds may have a higher risk of toxicity than those specifically targeting a virus protein, such toxicity may be acceptable for the relatively short time required to treat an acute infection. Many host-targeting compounds have that inhibit coronaviruses in vitro have been identified. They may act by inhibiting a cellular protein, influencing a signaling pathway, or modifying a cellular organelle. However, for many inhibitory compounds, the mechanism of action is not known. This section reviews compounds that appear to act primarily by influencing the host rather than the virus and that have favorable safety profiles. They are classified here into compounds that inhibit host proteases required for spike protein cleavage and those that act by other mechanisms.

### Host protease inhibitors
The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is required for the virus spike to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. These proteases include cell surface proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and other related transmembrane serine proteases; furin; and endosomal cathepsins [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. Accumulating data suggest that furin and TMPRSS2 mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2’ sites, respectively [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786]. Endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B and L appear to be less important for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV [^10.1073/pnas.0505577102][^10.1128/JVI.00094-12][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]

Camostat and nafamostat are serine protease inhibitors used in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. They inhibit TMPRSS2 in biochemical assays and coronaviruses in cell culture [^10.1101/2020.08.05.237651][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. In Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells, camostat inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s generally below 1 μM, while the EC<sub>50</sub>s for nafamostat are generally about 10-fold lower [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1128/AAC.00754-20][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257]. These compounds, however, are largely inactive in Vero cells because Vero cells do not require TMPRSS2 for virus entry [^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629]. Camostat has protected mice from fatal SARS-CoV infection [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. It is rapidly converted into the active metabolite GBPA [^10.1101/2020.08.05.237651][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. Nafamostat is associated with higher risk of toxicity compared with camostat and was associated with hyperkalemia in four consecutive critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.12998/wjcc.v8.i21.5320]. Camostat is currently being studied in approximately 10 phase 2 and phase 2/3 trials totaling about 2,500 patients at doses ranging from 600 mg to 2400 mg per day. Nafamostat is being studied in three small open-label trials.

Aprotinin is a 58 amino acid serine protease inhibitor, which inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of about 1 μM [^10.3390/cells9112377]. It has been used in Russia intravenously and inhalationally for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. There is one ongoing open-label trial examining the response to intravenous and inhalational aprotinin in 30 patients (NCT04527133).

Bromehexine is an oral mucolytic that has been identified as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor in a high-throughput screen for the treatment of prostate cancer [^10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-1010]. However, it did not inhibit TMPRSS2 in a more recent biochemical study [^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. Neither bromehexine nor its metabolite ambroxol have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.25.221135][^10.1101/2020.09.13.295691]. However, in a randomized open-label trial of 78 patients, oral administration was reported to significantly reduce ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and death [^10.34172/bi.2020.27]. Bromhexine is being studied in one large outpatient trial (IRCT20200818048444N1) and in several small open-label trials.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) is an endogenous protease inhibitor that is also used as a treatment for persons with severe α1-AT insufficiency. The pharmaceutical form is purified from human donor blood and is sold under the nonproprietary name α1–proteinase inhibitor and under various trade names. It has been reported to inhibit TMPRSS2 biochemically [^10.1101/2020.05.04.077826]. It has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in two studies [^10.1101/2020.08.14.248880][^10.1101/2020.07.02.183764] but not in a third study [^10.3390/cells9112377]. α1-AT is being studied in a phase two placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized non-ICU patients (NCT04547140).

### Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors
DHODH is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway. DHODH inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. Leflunomide is a DHODH inhibitor licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide has weak in vitro SARS-CoV-2 activity [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w]. Leflunomide was shown to reduce virus load and to improve symptomatic recovery by day 14 in a pilot open label randomized trial of 27 patients[^10.1101/2020.05.29.20114223] but it did not reduce viral clearance in an randomized open-label trial of 50 patients with prolonged post-symptomatic viral shedding [^10.1093/cid/ciaa1417]. Brequinar is a licensed DHODH inhibitor that appears to have greater activity than leflunomide in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. PTC299 is an investigational DHODH inhibitor which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w][^33269265]. It is an oral drug that is being developed for oncological indications. A phase II placebo-controlled trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071). IMU-838 is an investigational DHODH inhibitor [^10.3390/v12121394] being studied in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of 230 patients (NCT04379271).

### Apilimod
Apilimod inhibits the intracellular trafficking of several viruses including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of virus replication. It inhibits a kinase enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) involved in endosomal membrane formation. Although it does not alter the pH of endosomes or inhibit cathepsin B or L, it blocks entry of multiple viruses in both pseudovirus entry experiments and in cell culture assays [^10.1073/pnas.2007837117][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. In two large scale screening assays, it was found to have EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 10 to 90 nanomolar [^10.1038/s41586-020-2577-1][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.034]. It is an investigational compound that has been studied in human clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Apilimod is being studied in a phase II trial for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (NCT04446377).

### Chloroquine (CQ) analogs
CQ analogs have multiple intracellular actions that interfere with virus replication and/or the immune response to viral infections. CQ analogs are weak bases, that in their non-protonated form, concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and interfere with the trafficking of viruses that require a pH-dependent step for entry into the cytoplasm [^10.1016/s1473-3099(03)00806-5][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004502]. CQ analogs have also been reported to impair ACE2 glycosylation, which could theoretically diminish receptor binding by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69]. CQ analogs are anti-inflammatory and have been used for autoimmune conditions. CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have modest in vitro activity against MERS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], SARS-CoV [^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.085][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1038/s41598-020-70143-6] with most EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging between 1-10 μM in Vero cells but with higher EC<sub>50</sub>s in other cell lines.

Several large randomized placebo-controlled [^10.1056/NEJMoa2022926][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.7326/M20-4207] and open-label trials [^10.1056/NEJMoa2019014][^10.1136/bmj.m1849][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1009] showed no clinical or virological benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Two additional randomized trials showed that HCQ was also ineffective for post-exposure prophylaxis [^10.1056/NEJMoa2016638][^10.1056/NEJMoa2021801]. Two factors likely explain the lack of clinical efficacy of chloroquine analogs. First, cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in lung cells, depends primarily on the membrane-based enzyme TMPRSS2 rather than on endosomal fusion and acidification making it likely that the weak in vitro activity observed in Vero cells may not be clinically relevant [^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. Second, even at high dosages, CQ and HCQ do not achieve the drug levels that required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

### Ivermectin
Ivermectin is an antiparasitic agent that acts by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in the membranes of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. It has been reported to also inhibit human importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104760]. Ivermectin is a high molecular weight compound that weakly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with a reported EC<sub>50</sub> of about 2 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104787][^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. Plasma and lung levels of ivermectin following standard oral dosing have been estimated to be 10-100 fold lower than required to inhibit virus in vivo [^10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271][^32378737].

In a retrospective observational study, ivermectin use in 173 hospitalized patients was associated with significantly reduced mortality compared with 107 contemporaneous patients who did not receive ivermectin (15.0% vs. 25.2%; p=0.03), particularly in the subgroup with severe pulmonary disease defined as requiring an FiO2 >=50%, high flow oxygen, or mechanical ventilation (38.8% vs. 87.0%; p=0.001)[^10.1016/j.chest.2020.10.009]. In an open-label randomized trial of 140 patients with a wide range of disease, the time to recovery was shorter in those receiving a combination of ivermectin plus doxycycline, although there was no difference in the risk of disease progression or dying [^10.1101/2020.10.26.20219345]. As of November, ivermectin is being studied in 8 ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Niclosamide
Niclosamide is an oral anti-helminthic that exerts its antiparasitic effects by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity [^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00052]. In high-throughput drug repurposing screens, niclosamide has been found to have additional biological effects that appear to be associated either with its effect on endosomal acidification or preventing the disruption of autophagy [^10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.04.001][^10.1101/2020.04.15.997254]. Niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.48.7.2693-2696.2004][^10.1021/jm070295s], MERS-CoV [^10.1101/2020.09.24.310490], or SARS CoV-2 in cell culture with EC<sub>50</sub>s consistently below 1 μM predominantly in Vero cells. Oral, inhalational, and injectable formulations of niclosamide are being studied in nine ongoing or planned randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Nitazoxanide
Nitazoxanide is licensed for the treatment of cryptosporidium infections. It has been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses in vitro by interfering with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication including those involving interferon or mTORC1 [^10.1016/j.jiph.2016.04.001]. Its SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub> in Vero cells have been reported to be about 1 to 5 μM [^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of predominantly young outpatients with symptomatic disease, nitazoxanide did not influence time to symptom resolution but was associated with slightly more rapid virus load reductions. As of November, nitazoxanide is being studied in nine additional ongoing or planned placebo-controlled trials.

### Ciclesonide
Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid discovered in a high-throughput drug screen to inhibit coronavirus replication in the low μM range [^10.1128/JVI.01648-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582]. Although its mechanism of action is not known, MERS-CoV-2 passage in the presence of ciclesonide led to the selection of a point mutation in the nsp15 gene while multiple SARS-CoV-2 passage experiments led to nsp3 and nsp4 mutations shown to directly reduce ciclesonide susceptibility. The mutated regions of ns3 and ns4 are thought to be associated with double membrane formation. As of November, there are three ongoing randomized open-label trials and one planned placebo-controlled trial of inhaled ciclesonide.

### Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
The kinase inhibitor imatinib has been found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with EC<sub>50</sub>s of about 10 μM [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14]. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the early stages of coronavirus by affecting viral fusion with endosomal membranes specifically through ABL kinase inhibition [^10.1128/JVI.01429-16][^10.1099/jgv.0.001047]. Although imatinib also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, it has displayed inconsistent results in human alveolar cells [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1101/2020.11.17.386904][^10.1101/2020.05.05.079095]. Imatinib was also ineffective at reducing virus load or preventing weight loss in Syrian hamsters [^10.1101/2020.11.17.386904]. Imatinib is being studied in two randomized placebo-controlled trials.

### Cyclophilin inhibitors
Cyclosporin and FK-506 are immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors used to prevent rejection in transplant recipients. Cyclophilins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including protein folding, protein trafficking, and cell signaling. They play a role in the replication of several viruses including HIV-1, hepatitis C, influenza, and several coronaviruses [^10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.011]. Alisporivir is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor which has been studied primarily for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. However, cyclophilin inhibitors generally have weak inhibitory effects on coronavirus replication and in mice models [^10.1099/vir.0.034983-0][^10.1099/vir.0.052910-0][^10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.011][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1183/13993003.01826-2019]. There are several ongoing open-label studies of cyclosporin and alisporivir.

### Miscellaneous
Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug used in treatment of schizophrenia that has been reported to inhibit several viruses by interfering with viral entry into cells by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis [^10.7150/ijbs.45498][^10.1038/nrd.2015.37]. Two studies reported SARS-CoV-2 EC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 1 to 10 μM [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^33387629].

Emetine is an FDA-approved drug for treating amebiasis. It has been shown to inhibit multiple coronaviruses in vitro including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, with EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1.0 μM [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/JVI.00023-19][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582].. Its mechanism of action is uncertain, although it did inhibit MERS-CoV in an entry inhibitor assay using a pseudotype virus expressing S protein [^10.1128/JVI.00023-19]. After oral administration, its levels in the lungs are much higher than in the plasma and well above its reported EC<sub>50</sub> levels [^10.3390/ph13030051]. Emetine is currently not being studied in any SQRS-CoV-2 clinical trials.
