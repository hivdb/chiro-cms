## COVID-19 Antiviral Treatments
### Coronavirus Antiviral Research Database mission statement
The Coronavirus Antiviral Research Database is designed to expedite the development of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. It will benefit global coronavirus drug development efforts by (1) promoting uniform reporting of experimental results to facilitate comparisons between different candidate antiviral compounds; (2) identifying gaps in coronavirus antiviral drug development research; (3) helping scientists, clinical investigators, public health officials, and funding agencies prioritize the most promising compounds and repurposed drugs for further development; (4) providing an objective, evidenced-based, unbiased, and free source of truth for the public; and (5) creating a hub for the exchange of ideas among coronavirus researchers whose feedback is sought and welcomed. By comprehensively reviewing all published laboratory, animal model, and clinical data on potential coronavirus therapies, the Database makes it unlikely that promising treatment approaches will be overlooked. In addition, by making it possible to compare the underlying data associated with competing treatment strategies, stakeholders will be better positioned to prioritize the most promising anti-coronavirus compounds for further development.

### Current status and plans
The database website currently contains three tracks: (1) a database of published in vitro, animal model, and clinical data on small molecules, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, and interferons studied for inhibitory activity against one or more coronavirus species; (2) a linked registry of ongoing and planned clinical trials of potential anti-coronavirus compounds annotated according to study design, patient population, and planned clinical and virological outcomes; and (3) a comprehensively referenced and regularly updated evidence-based narrative summary of the state of coronavirus therapeutics. The narrative synthesizes data from the first two tracks, describe research findings relevant to coronavirus replication and drug development that do not lend themselves to inclusion in a database, and contain objective assessments of the most promising research directions. 

Additional planned work includes (1) the collection of human pharmacokinetic data on those compounds with promising results in clinical studies; (2) detailed descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies including information on their binding sites, epitopes, escape mutations, and Fc portions; (3) regularly updated curated alignments of coronavirus S, RdRp, 3CLpr, PLpr and potentially additional targets of therapy. Separate alignments will be created to track amino acid variation at four phylogenetic levels: SARS-CoV-2, sarbecovirus, betacoronaviruses, and coronaviruses. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 S sequence variability will be important to inform the development of monoclonal antibodies. Alignments of the key enzymatic targets of therapy will be important for identifying conserved sites important for drug design and for understanding which compounds demonstrating activity against one coronavirus are likely to be active against other species. 

### Rationale
One underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that there already exists in the public domain ample data to rationally develop new drugs and design clinical trials. More than 15 years of research on coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have identified many compounds capable of inhibiting specific steps in the coronavirus replication cycle. In the past three months, there has also been an outpouring of research on SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiple structures have been published of its spike protein, polymerase, replication complex, and protease enzymes. Many attempts are also being made to identify existing drugs or compounds already used in humans that can be repurposed to treat this and other acute viral infections. 

A second underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that drug development can be accelerated by creating a resource that juxtaposes the data associated with competing treatment strategies thus making it possible for academic laboratory researchers, clinical investigators, public health officials, and funding agencies to prioritize the most promising anti-coronavirus compounds for further development. The current paradigm of drug development involves competing entities engaged in compound screening, drug optimization, preclinical studies, pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials. The process is vertically but not horizontally integrated with different laboratories and companies pursuing competing agendas. The process is opaque to most stakeholders, in large part because no one has yet created what we are working on – a publicly available integrated representation and synthesis of the diverse forms of antiviral drug development data. 

The critical need for horizontal integration is evident from the fact that the vast majority of ongoing and planned clinical trials do not reflect the best available scientific research: more than two-thirds of trials include hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine and nearly one-fourth include non-coronavirus antiviral agents such as those targeting HIV-1 or influenza. Neither of these two approaches are supported by the available evidence.

### Work completed to date
As of April 28, 2020, we have extracted data linking antiviral compounds to coronaviruses from 225 publications including 180 peer-reviewed publications and 45 non-peer-reviewed pre-prints. The database contains 1121 cell culture experiments, 350 biochemical experiments, 308 entry assay experiments, 147 animal model experiments, and 36 clinical studies. More than 50% of the results are from studies of SARS-CoV (41%) or SARS-CoV-2 (15%); while the remainder are from studies of MERS-CoV (24%), endemic human coronaviruses (11%), and mammalian/bat coronaviruses (9%). There are currently 192 ongoing or planned clinical trials in which one or more of the treatment arms contains a compound intended to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The schema of the database can be found at https://covdb.stanford.edu/database-schema/. The database has been populated with the data described in the preceding paragraph and these data have been linked them to eight additional core look-up tables containing references, compounds, drug targets, virus species, virus strains, cell lines, virus measurements, and animal models. Each of the look-up tables contains definitions and explanatory text. The look-up tables ensure referential integrity and are designed to be educational. Their explanations are continually updated. 

Each compound is categorized according to its most likely target including both virus and host targets. The viral targets include entry inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies, fusion inhibitors, and additional small and large molecule inhibitors of receptor binding), RdRp inhibitors (nucleoside analogs); 3CL protease inhibitors; PL protease inhibitors; and helicase inhibitors. The host targets include interferons, inhibitors of host proteases that cleave coronavirus spike (S) proteins. A large number of additional compounds, particularly those purported to target host pathways, act by less well defined or completely uncertain mechanisms including inhibitors of endosomal trafficking, compounds that modulate signaling phosphorylation pathways, cyclophilin inhibitors, and compounds that may induce interferon production. Although coronaviruses contains four structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid), 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16), and several accessory proteins (Fehr and Perlman 2015; D. E. Gordon, Jang, Bouhaddou, et al. 2020)[^10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7_1][^10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9] most antiviral research has focused on the targets reviewed here.

## POLYMERASE INHIBITORS
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. RdRps are highly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families (Peersen 2019)[^10.3390/v11080745]. Coronavirus RNA polymerization, however, is more complex than that of other viruses. First, coronaviruses contain a 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN; nsp14) which is required for replication fidelity (Minskaia et al. 2006)[^10.1073/pnas.0508200103]. ExoN is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of coronavirus species such as SARS-CoV to ribavirin and other nucleoside analogs (Smith et al. 2013; Ferron et al. 2018)[^10.1371/journal.ppat.1003565][^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. Second, coronavirus RdRp (nsp12) requires two accessory proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The 3D structure of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex of SARS-CoV (Kirchdoerfer and Ward 2019)[^10.1038/s41467-019-10280-3] and SARS-CoV-2 (Gao et al. 2020)[^10.1126/science.abb7498] have been solved by cryo-EM.

Polymerase inhibitors are the most commonly used antiviral agents and have formed the backbone of most HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and herpes virus treatments. Nucleoside analog inhibitors are also often broad-spectrum possessing activity against multiple related virus species. Most antiviral polymerase inhibitors are nucleoside analog chain terminators – often because they lack a 3’-hydroxyl group. Several nucleoside analogs, however, are not chain terminators. Rather, they become incorporated into viral genomes and inhibit replication by introducing mutations during subsequent rounds of replication.

## Remdesivir
Remdesivir (GS-5734), is the monophosphate prodrug of the parent 1’-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analogue GS-441524 (Siegel et al. 2017)[^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01594]. The presence of the phosphate group allows for more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active nucleoside triphosphate form by bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step (Warren et al. 2016)[^10.1038/nature17180]. Remdesivir is a nonobligate chain terminator in that it contains a 3’-OH group. However, it causes delayed chain termination due to a steric clash after the addition of three trailing nucleosides (C. J. Gordon, Tchesnokov, Feng, et al. 2020; C. J. Gordon, Tchesnokov, Woolner, et al. 2020; Shannon et al. 2020)[^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056][^10.1074/jbc.RA120.013679][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793]. The mechanism by which it eludes coronavirus exonucleases is not known.

Remdesivir has broad spectrum activity against multiple RNA viruses and inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) below 1 M (Sheahan et al. 2017; Agostini et al. 2018; Sheahan, Sims, Leist, et al. 2020; M.

Remdesivir resistance in a related coronavirus – murine hepatitis virus (MHV) – has been selected during prolonged in vitro passage in the presence of remdesivir (Agostini et al. 2018)[^10.1128/mBio.00221-18]. The remdesivir-resistant mutations are in the RdRp fingers domain. Introducing the homologous substitutions into SARS-CoV (F480L + V557L) resulted in a virus with reduced replication and about 6-fold reduced susceptibility (Agostini et al. 2018)[^10.1128/mBio.00221-18].

Remdesivir is administered with a loading dose of 200 mg IV followed by 100 mg IV daily for 5 to 10 days in adult patients (Barlow et al. 2020; Amirian and Levy 2020)[^10.1002/phar.2398][^10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100128]. Following intravenous administration, the achievable maximum remdesivir plasma concentration (Cmax) is predicted to be at least twice as high as its most commonly reported EC50s (Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379].

In 53 COVID-19 patients receiving remdesivir as part of expanded access trials, 34 were receiving mechanical ventilation (including 3 on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation \[ECMO\]). Overall, 6 of the 34 ventilated patients and 1 of the 19 non-ventilated patients died (Grein et al. 2020)[^10.1056/NEJMoa2007016]. This death rate appeared lower than that of historical controls with similar levels of disease severity.

A phase 3 placebo-controlled trial begun in China in patients with moderate-to-severe disease was discontinued prematurely after recruiting 237 rather than the planned 453 patients. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive remdesivir. Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo (median 18 days \[IQR 12–28\] vs 23 days \[15–28\]; HR 1.52 \[0.95–2.43\]. The 28-day mortality was similar in both groups (14% for remdesivir and 13% for placebo). There was no difference in the rates of decline of nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels between the two groups. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were 12% of the remdesivir group and 5% in the placebo group (Y. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9].

H,Peter W. H,Bin C,Chen W. 2020. Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. The Lancet.
Preliminary results from the NIH Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) were announced on April 29th. The trial randomly assigned 1,063 hospitalized patients to remdesivir or placebo. There was a 31% shortening in the median time to study-defined recovery in the remdesivir group (11 vs. 15 days) which reached statistical significance. Mortality in the remdesivir group was lower in the remdesivir group (8% vs.11%) but this finding did not reach statistical significance. Based on this study, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who have severe disease defined as having an SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Conclusion: Remdesivir is the first antiviral compound that appears to be clinically beneficial. The optimal use of this drug will become clearer following the publication of the ACTT trial and two additional Gilead studies. The risks and benefits of using this drug in high-risk persons with mild-to-moderate disease will be important to study.

 

## β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (aka NHC and EIDD-2801)
β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine is a cytidine analogue that exerts its activity primarily through viral mutagenesis in that it incorporates into new RNA strands but leads to large numbers of replication errors during subsequent rounds of replication (Pruijssers and Denison 2019)[^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002]. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester is an orally available NHC prodrug. The mechanism by which β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine eludes coronavirus exonucleases is not known.
[^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002]: Andrea J. P,Mark R. D. 2019. Nucleoside analogues for the treatment of coronavirus infections. Curr Opin Virol.
β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most EC50s below 1 M (Barnard et al. 2004; 2006; Agostini et al. 2019; Sheahan, Sims, Zhou, et al. 2020)[^10.1177/095632020401500102][^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. It has also demonstrated activity in primary human airway epithelial cells and reduced virus levels, disease, and lung damage in mouse models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Sheahan, Sims, Zhou, et al. 2020)[^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. Deep sequencing studies have confirmed that viral mutagenesis is the main mechanism by which β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine inhibits coronaviruses (Agostini et al. 2019; Sheahan, Sims, Zhou, et al. 2020)[^10.1177/095632020401500102][^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883].

β-D-N4-Hydroxycytidine-5’-isopropyl ester (EIDD-2801) has demonstrated activity in a mouse model. It has received FDA approval for an Investigational New Drug Application, enabling its company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, to initiate human clinical testing. Although viral mutagenesis has rarely been previously shown to be an effective mechanism of viral inhibition, the large size of coronavirus genomes may make coronaviruses particularly vulnerable to viral mutagenesis. There have also been past concerns that non-chain-terminating nucleosides may be associated with toxicity to host polymerases. Nonetheless, in vitro studies have not identified effects on human RNA polymerases (Sticher et al. 2020; Toots et al. 2019)[^10.1128/AAC.01719-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.aax5866]. Moreover, the risk of toxicity for short courses of therapy are likely to be low.

G,Michael G. N,George R. P,Richard K. P. 2019. Characterization of orally efficacious influenza drug with high resistance barrier in ferrets and human airway epithelia. Sci Transl Med.
Conclusion: The preclinical in vitro and animal model data associated with EIDD-2801 are comparable to those of remdesivir. However, EIDD-2801’s safety in humans has not yet been established. Conducting safety and efficacy trials will likely require a minimum of three months. Should these trials be successful, this drug may be a useful oral option to could be used in high-risk outpatients. Moreover, used in combination with remdesivir it might further reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe disease. 

## Other nucleoside analogs
Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog with modest activity against several viruses. Although multiple mechanisms for its activity have been proposed, the most likely is an increase in viral mutagenesis. In cell culture studies, it has demonstrated little, if any, activity against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Cinatl et al. 2003; Barnard et al. 2004; J. F. W. Chan et al. 2013; Hart et al. 2014; Falzarano, de Wit, Martellaro, et al. 2013; Choy et al. 2020; Y. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13615-x][^10.1177/095632020401500102][^10.1016/j.jinf.2013.09.029][^10.1099/vir.0.061911-0][^10.1038/srep01686][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that although ribavirin 5’-monophosphate can be incorporated during RNA synthesis, it is readily excised by nsp14, the coronavirus exonuclease. Multiple observational clinical studies of patients with SARS-CoV and to a lesser extent in patients with MERS-CoV have shown no evidence for clinical benefit while demonstrating a high risk of toxicity (Stockman, Bellamy, and Garner 2006)[^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343]. Ribavirin is rarely used or studied for treating SARS-CoV-2.

Favipiravir (T-705) is a purine analog prodrug that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form the active metabolite favipiravir ibofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (aka T-705-RTP). It has broad spectrum activity against multiple viral RNA polymerases and appears to act by causing viral mutagenesis (Furuta et al. 2013; Delang, Abdelnabi, and Neyts 2018)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.015][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.03.003]. Favipiravir is approved in Japan for treating pandemic influenza infections. It appears relatively safe and it achieves high plasma concentrations following oral administration (Y.-X. Du and Chen 2020; Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1002/cpt.1844][^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379]. However, it has little, if any, inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with EC50s ranging from 60 to >100 M (M. Wang et al. 2020; Choy et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730].

In a recent open-label randomized trial of 240 patients, of whom just 40% had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, favipiravir was associated with an improved 7 day clinical recovery rate compared to Arbidol in a subgroup of patients without critical disease (71% vs 56%; p=0.02) (C. Chen et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.17.20037432]. However, the fact that diagnosis was confirmed in just 40% of patients raises the question as to what proportion of patients may have had influenza infections. As of April 20, 2020, there are 7 ongoing or planned clinical trials of favipiravir in about 700 SARS-CoV-2 patients of which just one is placebo-controlled.

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is an adenosine analog that inhibits multiple viruses including filovirus infections (Ebola virus and Marburg virus) in vitro and in rodents and cynomolgus macaques (Warren et al. 2014)[^10.1038/nature13027]. However, it has little, if any in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with EC50 levels of about 60 M for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Warren et al. 2014)[^10.1038/nature13027] and of >100 M for SARS-CoV-2 (Choy et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786]. At least seven additional nucleoside analogs have been studied in vitro against SARS-CoV, MERs-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 including four that are either approved (gemcitabine, mizoribine, or mycophenolate) or being studied in humans (merimepodib) as immunosuppressants or anticancer agents (Hart et al. 2014; Saijo et al. 2005; L.

Conclusions: There appears to be little benefit for the use or further study of the nucleoside analogs in this section either because they lack meaningful SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity or because they are immunosuppressive. 

## PROTEASE INHIBITORS
Coronaviruses contain two protease enzymes: 3 chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro or Main \[M\]-pro; non-structural protein 5 \[nsp5\]) and papain-like serine protease (PLpro; nsp3) (Ghosh et al. 2020)[^10.1002/cmdc.202000223]. 3CLpro cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at 11 sites. It is conserved among several families of RNA viruses and has similar cleavage site specificity to the picornavirus family of 3C proteases. 3CLpro contains 306 amino acids and functions as a homodimer. PLpro is part of a large multidomain transmembrane protein. It cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 boundaries and also cleaves host proteins important for innate immunity such as ubiquitin interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG-15). The 3D structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Anand et al. 2003)[^10.1126/science.1085658] and PLpro  (Báez-Santos et al. 2014)[^10.1021/jm401712t]; and of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Z. Jin et al. 2020; L. Zhang, Lin, Sun, et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y][^10.1126/science.abb3405] and PLpro () are available for structure-based drug design.

There are more candidate 3CLpro than PLpro inhibitors because of this enzyme’s similarities to those of other virus species. The recent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro structures have also identified tightly binding compounds with nanomolar-range half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in biochemical experiments (IC50s) and half-maximal effective concentrations in cell culture (EC50s). Most of the protease inhibitors (PIs) that are currently being studied clinically are curiously those that were approved for treating HIV-1 and display little if any SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity.

## HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors 
None of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) are expected to inhibit coronaviruses because the HIV-1 protease is an aspartate protease with a different specificity than the coronavirus 3CLpro and PLpro enzymes. Nonetheless, one particular HIV-1 PI combination – lopinavir boosted by ritonavir, which is an inhibitor of lopinavir metabolism (lopinavir/r) – has been used frequently to treat SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Each of the other HIV-1 associated PIs has also been studied for potential anti-coronavirus activity. 

Lopinavir/r was first used to treat a coronavirus infection when it was administered to a cohort of 75 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV in Hong Kong in 2003 (K. S. Chan et al. 2003; Chu et al. 2004)[^PMID14660806][^10.1136/thorax.2003.012658]. These 75 hospitalized patients included 44 newly diagnosed SARS-CoV patients and 31 who had more severe disease. Among the 44 newly diagnosed patients, 2% died and none required mechanical ventilation, whereas among the 31 patients with more severe disease, 13% died and 10% required intubation. The mortality rate and need for mechanical ventilation among the 44 newly diagnosed patients were lower than the rates observed in historical controls (i.e., the very first group of SARS patients treated at their hospital). The authors noted in their conclusion that the favorable response to lopinavir/r in the subset of the 44 newly diagnosed patients compared to historical controls may have resulted in part from the experience at treating patients with SARS (K. S. Chan et al. 2003; Chu et al. 2004)[^PMID14660806][^10.1136/thorax.2003.012658].

Lopinavir displays weak inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with EC50s of between 5 and >25 M or higher (Chu et al. 2004; F. Chen et al. 2004; N. Yamamoto et al. 2004; Barnard et al. 2006; J. F. W. Chan et al. 2013; de Wilde et al. 2014; Sheahan, Sims, Leist, et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2020; Choy et al. 2020; N. Yamamoto et al. 2020)[^10.1136/thorax.2003.012658][^10.1016/j.jcv.2004.03.003][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.083][^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.jinf.2013.09.029][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14][^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.04.06.026476](S. Liu et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.29.067983]. In addition, the selectivity index of lopinavir in cell culture is low suggesting that whatever inhibition is observed in cell culture may result from its toxic effects on the cells used to culture coronavirus rather than on the virus itself. In two biochemical assays with SARS-CoV 3CLpro, lopinavir displayed an IC50s of 50 M (C.-Y. Wu et al. 2004)[^10.1073/pnas.0403596101] and >20 M (Ma et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.20.051581]. In one study of marmosets infected with MERS-CoV, two animals receiving lopinavir/r had reduced mortality, virus levels, and lung pathology compared with three untreated control animals (J. F.-W. Chan et al. 2015)[^10.1093/infdis/jiv392]. However, no benefit was observed in mice infected with MERS-CoV treated with lopinavir/r + IFN-β (Sheahan, Sims, Leist, et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6].

Most importantly, an open-label randomized controlled trial of lopinavir/r vs. standard-of-care in 199 hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and SatO2 levels 94% or PaO2/FiO2 <300, demonstrated no significant difference in days to virological clearance, clinical improvement, need for mechanical ventilation, or mortality (Cao et al. 2020)[^10.1056/NEJMoa2001282].

Among the remaining HIV-1 PIs, only nelfinavir and atazanavir appeared to have any coronavirus inhibitory activity. Nelfinavir had EC50s of 0.05 and 3.5 M for SARS-CoV (Barnard et al. 2006; N. Yamamoto et al. 2004)[^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.083], 1.1 M and no activity for SARS-CoV-2 (N. Yamamoto et al. 2020; S. Liu et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.06.026476][^10.1101/2020.04.29.067983], and 3.6 M (Ko et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582] and no activity for MERS-CoV (J. F. W. Chan et al. 2013)[^10.1016/j.jinf.2013.09.029]. Its IC50 against SARS-CoV 3CLpro in a biochemical experiment was 46 M (Y.-C. Liu et al. 2005)[^10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.05.095]. Atazanavir had had EC50s against SARS-CoV-2 between 0.2 and 2 M in one study (Fintelman-Rodrigues et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.04.020925] but as high as 9.4 and >50 M in three other studies (Jeon et al. 2020; N.

Conclusion: As of April 21, 2020, there were 16 recruiting trials and 7 planned trials containing a lopinavir/r treatment arm. However, considering that lopinavir/r does not inhibit coronaviruses in vitro and displayed no clinical or virological activity in a randomized clinical trial, it is uncertain why it is still being used clinically or studied. 

## 3CLpro INVESTIGATIONAL INHIBITORS
Most coronavirus PI drug discovery efforts have targeted 3CLpro: it shares a conserved substrate recognition pocket with the 3C like protease (3Cpro) of human picornaviruses, which have already been successfully targeted with antiviral agents. In addition, 3CLpro can also be purified in large quantities and readily crystallized (Grum-Tokars et al. 2008)[^10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.015].

There have been multiple drug screens and several structure-based designs targeting 3CLpro The 3Cpro inhibitor rupintrivir (AG7088), which has demonstrated safety and symptom improvement in humans has not demonstrated significant activity against coronavirus 3CLpro (Kim et al. 2012)[^10.1128/JVI.01348-12]. However, several derivatives of this peptidomimetic have inhibited SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in biochemical assays with IC50s ranging between 0.2 and 0.7 M for SARS-CoV and 1.7 and 4.7 M for MERS-CoV (Kumar et al. 2017)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.02.007].

Another derivative, GC376, forms covalent bonds with three active site cysteines and inhibits multiple coronaviruses (Kim et al. 2012)[^10.1128/JVI.01348-12]. GC376 inhibits SARS-CoV (4.3 M) and MERS-CoV (1.7 M) and displays sub-micromolar inhibitory against several other coronaviruses including the alphacoronavirus FIPV, TGEV, and HCoV 229E and the betacoronavirus BCV. It is highly effective in treating cats with the rapidly fatal coronavirus disease FIPV (Kim et al. 2016)[^10.1371/journal.ppat.1005531]. Crystal structures of MERS-CoV 3CLpro bound to GC376 has led to the identification of piperidene peptidomimetics with greater inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Galasiti Kankanamalage et al. 2018)[^10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.004]. Another series of peptidomimetics has been shown to inhibit BtCoV-HKU4 (related to MERS-CoV). Asymmetric aromatic disulfides have had low micromolar activity against SARS-CoV (Li Wang et al. 2017)[^10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.05.045]. Several other backbones have been shown to have activity against SARS-CoV (Shie et al. 2005; Ghosh et al. 2007)[^10.1021/jm050184y][^10.1016/j.bmcl.2007.08.031].

The compounds with the most 3CLpr inhibitory activity identified to date are a series of peptidomimetic -ketoamide derivatives (L. Zhang, Lin, Kusov, et al. 2020)[^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b01828]. One of these compounds has been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and has been modified to increase its solubility. Preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluation has demonstrated metabolic stability in mouse and human microsomes and encouraging plasma and bronco-alveolar lavage fluid levels whether administered subcutaneously or by inhalation (L. Zhang, Lin, Sun, et al. 2020)[^10.1126/science.abb3405]. A second SARS-CoV-2 crystal structure identified of several inhibitory compounds, of which the most active were N3 and an investigational compound ebselen, which has been studied in humans (Z.

Disulfiram, the licensed oral alcohol antagonist has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease with an IC50 of about 10 M (Z. Jin et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y] and to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PL protease with a slightly higher IC50  (Lin et al. 2018)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.015]. However, disulfiram has not yet been studied in cell culture and existing PK data suggests that standard doses may be insufficient to yield inhibitory drug levels.

Conclusion: There are many promising lead compounds that could be developed into highly effective SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Several of these including GC376 and ebselen might be useful as initial scaffolds because they display very low M activity and have been studied in cats and humans, respectively. Other peptidomimetic compounds, such as the -ketoamides have greater inhibitory in vitro activity but have not yet been studied in animals or humans. Developing these compounds into drugs would ordinarily take several years. 

## PLpro INVESTIGATIONAL INHIBITORS
The crystal structure of SARS-CoV (Ratia et al. 2006; Báez-Santos et al. 2014)[^10.1073/pnas.0510851103][^10.1021/jm401712t] and SARS-CoV-2 () have been solved. However, in contrast to 3CLpro, the PLpro enzyme is membrane associated, making it more challenging to study in vitro. It does not have homologues in other viruses, so there are fewer compounds that can serve as starting points for drug development. Nonetheless, it is an essential coronavirus enzyme, and high-throughput testing approaches have begun, and several lead compounds have been identified (Báez-Santos, St John, and Mesecar 2015; Ghosh et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.015][^10.1002/cmdc.202000223].

## ENTRY INHIBITORS
Coronavirus cell entry is mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein. S is a membrane protein essential for the two main steps of the entry process: attachment to the host cell and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The functional S protein is a trimer of identical subunits. For most coronaviruses, S is processed by host proteases to generate two functional subunits, designated S1 and S2. The S1 subunit forms the apex of the S trimer including the receptor binding domains (RBDs) (Tortorici and Veesler 2019)[^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002] and is responsible for attachment to cellular receptors. The S2 unit is responsible for fusion to the cell membrane. 
[^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]: M. Alejandra T,David V. 2019. Structural insights into coronavirus entry. Adv. Virus Res..
The 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer has been determined by cryo-EM (Wrapp et al. 2020)[^10.1126/science.abb2507]. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (W. Li et al. 2003; P. Zhou et al. 2020)[^10.1038/nature02145][^10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7]. An extended insertion within the structurally similar SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs called the receptor-binding motif (RBM) contains most of the S amino acids responsible for ACE2 binding (Wong et al. 2004; Lan et al. 2020; X. Xu et al. 2020)[^10.1074/jbc.C300520200][^10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5][^10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5]. S binding to ACE2 does not interfere with ACE2’s catalytic activity (Li et al., 2005). However, ACE2 internalization following infection leads to the loss of ACE2’s lung protective effects. S1-ACE2 affinity is higher for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, possibly explaining its greater infectiousness (Lan et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5].

S2 contains two complementary heptad repeat (HR) regions, designated HR1 and HR2, which are alpha helices with repeated patterns of seven amino acids that have regions that can bind to one another. HR1 projects out to the host cell membrane whereas HR2 is about 170 amino acids upstream and closer to the virus membrane (Jean Kaoru Millet and Whittaker 2015)[^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021]. HR1 and HR2 collapse onto one another to create a hairpin which brings the viral and cell membranes together promoting fusion. As S2 (like S1) functions as a trimer, the hairpin formed by the interaction of HR1 and HR2 is referred to as a six-helix bundle.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have two main cleavage sites. One is at the S1/S2 boundary and the other is at a site within S2 referred to as the S2’ site. These sites must be cleaved by host proteases in order for the S1 and S2 to undergo the necessary conformational change to shift from receptor binding to cell fusion (Tortorici and Veesler 2019)[^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. The specific cleavage sites, the responsible host enzymes, and the cellular locations at which cleavage occurs varies among different coronaviruses and likely also in different cell types; this variation is believed to play a role in cellular tropism and pathogenesis (Jean Kaoru Millet and Whittaker 2015; Tortorici and Veesler 2019)[^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. Several candidate host proteases appear to be particularly important for processing S1 and S2 including TMPRSS2, a surface transmembrane serine protease, endosomal cathepsins, and furin. In contrast, to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which appears to be cleaved during biosynthesis (Walls et al. 2020; Coutard et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104742]. It has been speculated that the presence of this cleavage site may have expanded the transmissibility and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 considering the more widespread expression of furin-like proteases in host cells.

This section describes interventions that interfere with virus entry including convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies that block S1 receptor binding, fusion inhibitors, and several other receptor binding inhibitors. Compounds that inhibit the host protease enzymes required for cleaving the S protein are described in the section on host-acting compounds.

## Convalescent Plasma
There are few randomized controlled studies of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe viral infections. A systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies of convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin for SARS-CoV was considered inconclusive with respect to potential benefits and harm (Stockman, Bellamy, and Garner 2006)[^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343]. A larger, more recent meta-analysis of 32 studies of severe SARS-CoV and influenza, reported that convalescent plasma, when administered early after symptom onset showed a statistically significant 75% reduction in the pooled odds of mortality compared with placebo or no therapy (Mair-Jenkins et al. 2015)[^10.1093/infdis/jiu396]. There are currently three published observational studies of convalescent plasma in 19 severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients, including 13 who were receiving mechanical ventilation (Duan et al. 2020; C. Shen et al. 2020; B. Zhang et al. 2020)[^10.1073/pnas.2004168117][^10.1001/jama.2020.4783][^10.1016/j.chest.2020.03.039]. All patients received 200 ml plasma, and in 15 cases, the donor had neutralizing antibody titers >1:640. All 19 patients survived and appeared to experience clinical improvement within three days.

According to FDA guidance, the administration of SARS-CoV-3 convalescent plasma must be under an investigational new drug application. Donors must have had resolution of symptoms 28 days before their donation or 14 days before if they have negative nasopharyngeal or blood PCR tests. The recommend neutralizing antibody titers should be  1:160 (minimum >1:80). As of April 17, 2020, there are 28 ongoing (n=8) or planned (n=20) clinical trials containing at least one arm in which recipients will receive convalescent plasma. There are also two planned studies of convalescent immunoglobulin and one of pooled immunoglobulin from healthy donors. One ongoing study is randomizing patients to convalescent plasma or to standard donor plasma and another planned study aims to randomize high-risk exposed persons to convalescent plasma or placebo. The remaining studies are not placebo controlled. Despite its potential for toxicity (i.e., undetected bloodborne infections and allergic reactions) and lot-to-lot variation in functional neutralizing antibodies (Y. Jin et al. 2017)[^10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6], convalescent plasma and potentially other forms of immunoglobulin therapy will likely remain a treatment option particularly in patients with severe disease.

Conclusions: Although the use of convalescent plasma is not supported by controlled trials, substantial observational data supports this intervention. The usefulness of convalescent plasma also suggests that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies should be useful at treating what at least clinically is primarily a respiratory tract infection. However, human plasma is a complex mixture of compounds. Therefore, the two trials in which convalescent plasma will be compared to standard donor plasma (one for treatment and the other for prevention) would be extremely informative if they are completed. 

## Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)
Neutralizing MAbs have been to treat Ebola (Corti et al. 2016; Mulangu et al. 2019)[^10.1126/science.aad5224][^10.1056/NEJMoa1910993] and prevent respiratory syncytial virus (Scott and Lamb 1999)[^10.2165/00003495-199958020-00009]. Neutralizing MAbs have also be used reduce virus levels in HIV-1-infected persons but resistance emerges unless a combination of neutralizing MAbs is administered (Caskey et al. 2017; Mendoza et al. 2018)[^10.1038/nm.4268][^10.1038/s41586-018-0531-2].

Recovery during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is usually associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies (Y. Jin et al. 2017)[^10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6]. Most SARS-CoV neutralizing MAbs target the part of the receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds ACE2 while most MERS-CoV neutralizing MAbs target the part of the RBD that binds its cellular receptor (Hofmann et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2004; Y. He et al. 2005)[^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.114][^10.1074/jbc.C300520200][^10.4049/jimmunol.174.8.4908]. Several potent humanized neutralizing MAbs targeting SARS-CoV (Coughlin and Prabhakar 2012)[^10.1002/rmv.706] and MERS-CoV (L. Jiang et al. 2014; Lingshu Wang et al. 2015; H.-J.

Crystallization and site-directed mutagenesis studies have defined the specific RBD epitopes recognized by individual MAbs and identified those amino acid residues critical for MAb binding  (Yan Li et al. 2015)[^10.1038/cr.2015.113].

Most SARS-CoV MAbs do not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Q. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045]. For example, three well-characterized SARS-CoV RBD-directed MAbs (S230, m396, and 80R) did not bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD at a concentration of 1M (Wrapp et al. 2020)[^10.1126/science.abb2507]. However, CR3022 was found to potently bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Tian et al. 2020)[^10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069] possibly because it recognizes a more conserved site on the S1 RBD. In addition, in a recent analysis of antibody-containing supernatants from 51 SARS-CoV S hybridomas from immunized transgenic mice, one antibody called 47D11 was uniquely found to inhibit both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in an entry assay and in cell culture with EC50 values of 0.2 and 0.6 g/ml. 47D11 like CR3022 may act through an unknown mechanism different from receptor binding.

Most individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 develop significant titers of neutralizing antibodies (F. Wu et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365]. Although few published studies have described the isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing MAbs, this will soon be rapidly changing. Many MAbs that recognize SARS-CoV-2 will be identified and will be characterized by the their breadth of activity against diverse strains and their ability to prevent and treat infection in animal models  (S. Jiang, Hillyer, and Du 2020)[^10.1016/j.it.2020.03.007]. In one recent study of 26 persons recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, most developed IgG S1-specific antibodies (X. Chen et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41423-020-0426-7]. Three of these persons had antibodies that could block S1-ACE2 binding. Two MAbs were cloned from these patients (311mab–31B5, 311mab−32D4) and shown to potently inhibit S1-ACE2 binding and block pseudovirus entry (X. Chen et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41423-020-0426-7]. Several biotechnology companies have announced plans to begin trials of MAbs this summer.

Conclusions: The preliminary data suggesting that convalescent plasma is useful for treating SARS-CoV-2 and the ability of MAbs to successfully treat Ebola suggests that MAbs will be useful at both treating and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although coronaviruses do not appear to mutate at high rates compared to other RNA viruses, a combination of at least two non-cross-reactive MAbs will nonetheless be required to prevent the rapid emergence of resistance.

## Fusion Inhibitors
Peptides that mimic HR1 or HR2 can block virus-cell fusion by preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2. An HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide is a 36 amino acid peptide that acts by this mechanism to inhibit HIV-1 replication following subcutaneous administration (Lalezari et al. 2003; Lazzarin et al. 2003)[^10.1056/NEJMoa035026][^10.1056/NEJMoa035211]. Several peptide mimics of coronavirus HR2 have been shown to be potently inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Yuan et al. 2004; Lu et al. 2014; Channappanavar et al. 2015; C. Wang et al. 2018; Xia et al. 2019; Y. Zhu et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.046][^10.1038/ncomms4067][^10.1093/infdis/jiv325][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00890][^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580][^10.1101/2020.03.26.009233]. The interest in coronavirus fusion inhibitors derives in part because S2 is more conserved than S1 among different coronavirus species. For example, the S1 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, differ by more than 10%. However, their HR1 domains differ by 7% and their HR2 domains are essentially identical (Xia, Zhu, et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41423-020-0374-2].

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an HR2 mimicking peptide named EK1 was identified as a potential broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor as it inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at sub-micromolar levels and was found to safe and protective when administered intranasally to SARS-CoV-infected mice (Xia et al. 2019)[^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580]. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 six helix bundle was solved, and several modifications were made to EK1 peptide. In addition, a cholesterol group was added (Xia, Liu, et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x] as lipidation had recently been shown empirically to improve the pharmacokinetics and inhibitory activity of viral fusion inhibitors (Chong et al. 2017)[^10.1128/JVI.00288-17]. This new lipopeptide, named EK1C4 was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 fusion 150 times more strongly than EK1, with SARS-CoV-2 EC50s of 0.04 M and 0.004 M in cell culture for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and of even lower EC50s in cell-cell fusion assays.

Conclusion: In theory, safety and PK studies of a fusion inhibitor such as EK1C4 could begin immediately to determine the ideal mode of administration (parenteral, intranasal, inhalational), the risk of hypersensitivity, and the plasma half-life. Whereas peptides can be administered parenterally or by inhalation, it is not known whether the same would apply to a lipopeptide. In contrast to MAbs, the half-life of fusion inhibitors will be short and could therefore be used solely for treatment.

## Soluble ACE2 and Other Molecular Decoys 
Soluble recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) has two potential beneficial effects. First, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rhACE2 has been studied to protect lungs from injury during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Imai et al. 2005; Kuba et al. 2005; Khan et al. 2017; Monteil et al. 2020)[^10.1038/nature03712][^10.1038/nm1267][^10.1186/s13054-017-1823-x][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004]. Second, rhACE2 inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells (Hofmann et al. 2004; Q. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.114][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045] and has displayed does-dependent activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells and engineered human blood vessel and kidney organoids (Monteil et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004]. APN1 (Apeiron Biologics) is a recombinant form of human ACE2, that demonstrated safety in 89 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients and volunteers. It is now being evaluated in a 200-person placebo-controlled study of hospitalized persons with SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04335136). Another more recently described similar approach involving the use of a fusion protein – in which an inactive ACE2 mutant is linked to a human Fc IgG – is highly active in vitro (Lei et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41467-020-16048-4].

The complete ACE2 molecule may not be necessary to inhibit viral infection if a synthetic peptide can be constructed with a critical minimal subset of ACE2 amino acids capable of competing with cellular ACE2 for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Preliminary data from SARS-CoV suggest that multiple residues from different parts of the ACE2 molecule will be required including amino acids between positions 24–90 and 329–354 (F. Li et al. 2005)[^10.1126/science.1116480]. Two ACE2-derived peptides between positions 22–57 demonstrated some in vitro against SARS-CoV (D. P. Han, Penn-Nicholson, and Cho 2006)[^10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.029]. Another peptide comprising two discontinuous ACE2 segments containing residues 22–44 and 351–357 artificially linked together by glycine, exhibited more potent in vitro activity with an EC50 of about 0.1 M (D. P. Han, Penn-Nicholson, and Cho 2006)[^10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.029].

Conclusion: rhACE2 may prove to be useful in patients with the most severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

## Miscellaneous Other Potential Entry Inhibitors
Spike-mimicking 20-mer peptides corresponding to different S1 and/or S2 regions were reported in one study to synergistically interfere with SARS-CoV entry into cells presumably by competing with complete virus for ACE2 binding (B.-J. Zheng et al. 2005)[^PMID15918330]. However, few other studies have described this approach. Moreover, the inhibition of ACE2 enzymatic function or down-regulation of ACE2 levels is precarious as the absence of ACE2 is associated with the same pulmonary and cardiovascular disturbances observed during severe SARS-CoV and presumably SARS-CoV-2 infection.

W,Hsiang-fu K,Kwok-Yung Y,Jian-Dong H. 2005. Synthetic peptides outside the spike protein heptad repeat regions as potent inhibitors of SARS-associated coronavirus. Antivir. Ther. (Lond.).
Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by white blood cells and epithelial cells, which have a role in innate immunity. In a study of several peptides derived from mouse β-defensin-4, one 30 amino acid peptide called P9 was found to inhibit influenza A, MERS-Co-V, and SARS-CoV both in vitro and in a mouse model (Zhao et al. 2016)[^10.1038/srep22008].

Griffithsin, a 121 amino acid protein isolated from red algae, inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro with EC50s in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 to M without inducing cell toxicity. It also inhibits SARS-CoV when delivered intranasally in a mouse model (O’Keefe et al. 2010; Jean K. Millet et al. 2016)[^10.1128/JVI.02322-09][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.011]. Time course experiments suggest that griffithsin interferes with virus cell entry (Jean K. Millet et al. 2016)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.011]. While ELISA assays showed that it binds directly to the S glycoprotein, it does not inhibit S binding to ACE2 suggests that griffithsin may prevent the subsequent steps needed for viral entry (O’Keefe et al. 2010)[^10.1128/JVI.02322-09].

VE607 was reported in one study to inhibit SARS-CoV S protein-ACE2-mediated cell entry (Kao et al. 2004)[^10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.07.013] but does not appear to have been studied further. HTCC polymers are cationacally modified chitosan derivatives that appear to inhibit cell entry of multiple coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Milewska et al. 2020; 2016)[^10.1101/2020.03.29.014183][^10.1371/journal.pone.0156552]. SARS-RBD-Hexapeptide is weak inhibitor of SARS-CoV viral entry, which nonetheless suggests the possibility that small peptides may be able to inhibit the interaction of coronavirus S1 receptor binding domains and ACE2 (Struck et al. 2012)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.12.012]. Emodin is a plant derivative that appears to weakly inhibit SARS-CoV S protein-ACE2-mediated cell entry (Ho et al. 2007)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2006.04.014], although it has also been proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV release from cells (Schwarz et al. 2011)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.008].

Arbidol is an oral drug used in Russia and China to treat influenza and other viral infections (Blaising, Polyak, and Pécheur 2014; Pécheur et al. 2016)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.04.006][^10.1128/JVI.02077-15]. It is reported to have in vitro activity against multiple viruses and to inhibit viral entry by binding viral surface glycoproteins (Leneva et al. 2009)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.10.009]. A crystal structure of arbidol in complex with influenza hemagglutinin showed that arbidol binds to a hydrophobic cavity in hemagglutinin trimer stem (Kadam and Wilson 2017)[^10.1073/pnas.1617020114]. There have been five small studies of arbidol in patients with SARS-CoV-2, including two open-label controlled studies (C. Chen et al. 2020; Yueping Li et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.17.20037432][^10.1101/2020.03.19.20038984] and three observational studies (Deng et al. 2020; Zhen Zhu et al. 2020; Q.

One controlled trial suggested it was inferior to favipiravir at reducing time to clinical recovery (C. Chen et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.17.20037432]; one observational trial suggested it was inferior to nebulized interferon α2b at reducing viral shedding; and one observational trial suggested that it may have been more effective than lopinavir/r at reducing viral shedding (Zhen Zhu et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.060].

Conclusion: Most of the compounds in this section have not been well studied and therefore appear unlikely at the present time to lead to useful treatments.

## INTERFERONS (IFNs)
IFNs respond to the presence of cellular changes suggestive of a viral infection by inducing numerous genes (IFN-stimulated genes \[ISGs\]) involved in inflammation, signaling, and immunomodulation to protect against uncontrolled infection. They interfere with viral replication by slowing cell metabolism, interfering with the membrane formation required for virus replication, and secreting cytokines that promote adaptive immunity (Sallard et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104791]. The importance of IFN is underscored by the fact that most viruses, and in particular coronaviruses, create many protein products specifically designed to antagonize cellular IFN signaling pathways (Totura and Baric 2012; B. X. Wang and Fish 2019)[^10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004][^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. While one might therefore expect that exogenously administered IFN would be a mainstay in the treatment of acute viral infections, this is surprisingly not the case.

There are three IFN families (McNab et al. 2015)[^10.1038/nri3787]. Type I IFN includes 13 related IFN- subtypes and a single IFN-β. Type II IFN consists of a single gene product IFN-. Type III IFN consists of IFN-1, IFN-2, and IFN-3. Several IFN- products have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus, and several malignancies. IFN-β, IFN-, and IFN- have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, congenital immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease, and hepatitis delta infection, respectively, Commercial IFN- products vary the according to the extent to which they include different IFN- subtypes. The biological and clinical significance of the differences between the different IFN- products are not known (B. X. Wang and Fish 2019)[^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. Pegylated interferons have a longer half-life because the attached polyethylene glycol causes interferon to be cleared more slowly.

As of April 27, 2020, there have been eight observational studies of IFN- or IFN-β in patients with MERS-CoV (4 studies), SARS-CoV (2 studies), or SARS-CoV-2 (2 studies). However, no conclusions regarding efficacy could be drawn due the absence of control groups. There are also 10 ongoing studies of subcutaneous or intranasal IFN- or IFN-β, although nearly all of these studies contain multiple treatment arms and lack control groups. There are three planned studies of IFN-, including one with a placebo arm. 

One study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to IFN- than SARS-CoV-1, due to a deletion in ORF3b, a 154 amino acid protein known to antagonize one of the proteins involved in the cellular IFN response (Lokugamage, Schindewolf, and Menachery 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.07.982264]. However, the diverse nature of the commercial IFN products and of published studies has made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the optimal use of IFNs. Both IFN- and IFN-β appear to inhibit coronavirus in vitro and in animal models, although several authors have argued that IFN-β is more effective than IFN- at inhibiting coronaviruses (Sallard et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104791]. Theoretical and empirical data suggest that IFNs should be administered as early as possible in the course of infection (Channappanavar et al. 2019)[^10.1172/JCI126363] when innate immunity is likely to be most needed; this would also avoid exacerbating the unregulated exuberant damaging immune response that often occurs in the later stages of severe coronavirus infections. Although far fewer data are available for IFN-s, they have garnered much interest because they act at epithelial barriers theoretically making them optimal for treating viral respiratory tract infections and because they are reported to suppress viral spread without causing inflammation (Davidson et al. 2016; O’Brien et al. 2020)[^10.15252/emmm.201606413][^10.1093/cid/ciaa453].

Conclusion: Considering the multiple proteins produced by coronaviruses to down regulate-host innate immunity and the generally favorable response to IFN in vitro and in animal models, rigorously designed studies of the early use of IFNs following SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed to determine whether there already exists a highly effective SARS-CoV-2 treatment.

## ADDITIONAL HOST-TARGETING COMPOUNDS
With the exception of interferons, all approved antivirals target specific steps in a virus’s replication cycle. However, the concept of developing drugs that target host pathways has gained increasing interest during the past several years and has reached a fever pitch with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Host acting drugs have a number of theoretical advantages for treating acute pandemic infections. First, potential host acting antiviral drugs may have already been approved or undergone human testing for other conditions, making it possible to repurpose them to treat SARS-CoV-2. Second, host-acting drugs might theoretically be able to inhibit multiple viruses, since many viruses depend on similar host factors and pathways. Third, although drugs targeting host factors may have a higher risk of cellular toxicity compared to drugs that specifically target a virus protein, such toxicity may be acceptable for the several days required to treat an acute viral infection.

During the past 17 years, hundreds of compounds have been identified that appear to inhibit coronaviruses in vitro by inhibiting a cellular protein, influencing a signaling pathway, or modifying a cellular organelle. For some of these compounds, it has been possible to determine their mechanism of action. For example, several protease inhibitors have been shown to inhibit host proteases required for cleaving the viral S protein enabling it to transition from receptor binding to cell fusion (Jean Kaoru Millet and Whittaker 2015; Tortorici and Veesler 2019)[^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. However, for many other compounds it is difficult to pinpoint their mechanism of action. This section reviews compounds that appear to act primarily by influencing the host rather than the virus and that are described in multiple studies, demonstrate in vitro potency, and have favorable safety profiles. These compounds have been categorized into those that (i) inhibit host proteases required for S protein cleavage; (ii) appear to inhibit virus endosomal trafficking; or (3) act by additional or uncertain mechanisms.

## Host Protease Inhibitors
The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is critical for the virus to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. Many host proteases have been shown to proteolytically process the spike (S) protein including cell surface proteases such as transmembrane protease/serine proteases, endosomal cathepsins, furin, and trypsin (Jean Kaoru Millet and Whittaker 2015)[^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021]. Coronaviruses usually require that S is cleaved at two sites – the S1/S2 juncture and at a second site within S2 referred to as S2’. The specific enzymes involved depend in part on the virus species, the amino acid sequence at the S1/S2 boundary and at the S2’ site, and the infected cells. 
[^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021]: Jean Kaoru M,Gary R. W. 2015. Host cell proteases: Critical determinants of coronavirus tropism and pathogenesis. Virus Res..
In contrast to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 contains a functional polybasic furin cleavage site at the S1–S2 boundary (Walls et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058]. This observation and accumulating data support the tentative conclusion that cleavage at the S1/S2 by furin and of S2’ by TMPRSS2 are likely to be particularly important host proteases for SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al. 2020; Bestle et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085]. However, the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L, which together with TMPRSS2, are considered essential host proteases for SARS-CoV (Simmons et al. 2005; Glowacka et al. 2011; Shulla et al. 2011; Kawase et al. 2012; Shirato, Kawase, and Matsuyama 2018; Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al. 2020; Bestle et al. 2020)[^10.1073/pnas.0505577102][^10.1128/JVI.02232-10][^10.1128/JVI.02062-10][^10.1128/JVI.00094-12][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085] may also be involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry in certain cell types (Bestle et al. 2020; M. Yamamoto et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085][^10.1101/2020.04.22.054981].

The anticoagulant nafamostat potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro: an existing drug with multiple possible therapeutic effects. Biorxiv.
Two serine protease inhibitors available for human use in Japan, camostat and nafamostat, are believed to inhibit coronaviruses primarily through their inhibition of TMPRSS2. Both drugs have potently inhibited MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in pseudovirus entry inhibitor assays and in cell culture (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al. 2020; Hoffmann, Schroeder, et al. 2020; M. Yamamoto et al. 2020; Bojkova et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1128/AAC.00754-20][^10.1101/2020.04.22.054981][^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257]. Camostat has also protected mice from fatal SARS-CoV infection (Y. Zhou et al. 2015)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. Both camostat and nafamostat appear to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at lower concentrations than SARS-CoV(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, et al. 2020; Hoffmann, Schroeder, et al. 2020; M. Yamamoto et al. 2020; Bojkova et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1128/AAC.00754-20][^10.1101/2020.04.22.054981][^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257]. In Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, camostat inhibited SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with EC50s generally below 1 M, while the EC50s for nafamostat have been about 10 to 100-fold lower. However, the EC50s for both drugs against both viruses are considerably higher in Vero cells (Jeon et al. 2020; M. Yamamoto et al. 2020; Y. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730][^10.1101/2020.04.22.054981][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9] suggesting that TMPRSS2 inhibition alone may not be sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in these cells (Bestle et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085]. Two studies have reported that a third serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, which is available in Russia as an aerosol preparation displayed comparable inhibitory activity to camostat (Bojkova et al. 2020; Bestle et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257][^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085].

Several small molecule cathepsin inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit coronaviruses in vitro. K11777, an investigational inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, was found to inhibit a variety of cysteine proteases including human cathepsins (Y. Zhou et al. 2015)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. It also potently inhibited SARS-CoV in cell culture and virus entry assays at sub-micromolar concentrations (Y. Zhou et al. 2015)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. Several K11777 derivatives including SMDC256159 and SMDC256160 were also shown to be potent SARS-CoV inhibitors. Each of these compounds and K11777 synergistically inhibited SARS-CoV when administered in combination with camostat. MG132, MDL28170, and other calpain inhibitors have been found to inhibit SARS-CoV with EC50s in the low M range (Schneider et al. 2012; Simmons et al. 2005; Barnard et al. 2006)[^10.1128/JVI.01001-12][^10.1073/pnas.0505577102][^10.1177/095632020601700505].

Several synthetic furin inhibitors have also shown to inhibit coronaviruses in vitro including MI-1851, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 alone and synergistically in combination with TMPRSS2 inhibitors (Bestle et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.15.042085] and dec-RVKR-CMK, which weakly inhibited MERS-CoV in a pseudovirus entry assay (Jean Kaoru Millet and Whittaker 2014)[^10.1073/pnas.1407087111].

Conclusion: Clinical studies of camostat and nafamostat are just beginning but their numbers are very low. These studies should be a high priority. It remains possible, however, that it may also be necessary to inhibit furin and possibly cathepsins to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in patients.

## Inhibitors of endosomal trafficking
Chloroquine and its analogs have been reported to have multiple intracellular actions that may interfere with virus replication and/or the immune response to viral infections. Chloroquine analogs are weak bases, that, in their non-protonated form, penetrate and concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. In these organelles, chloroquine analogs may interfere with the trafficking of viruses that require a pH-dependent step for entry (Savarino et al. 2003; Burkard et al. 2014)[^10.1016/s1473-3099(03)00806-5][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004502]. Chloroquine analogs have also been reported to impair ACE2 glycosylation, which could theoretically diminish the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding (Vincent et al. 2005)[^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69]. They are also anti-inflammatory, which explains their use for autoimmune conditions.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have demonstrated modest inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV (Dyall et al. 2014; Shin et al. 2018; de Wilde et al. 2014)[^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.3390/v10060283][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], SARS-CoV (Vincent et al. 2005; Barnard et al. 2006; Keyaerts et al. 2004; de Wilde et al. 2014)[^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69][^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.085][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], and SARS-CoV-2 (M. Wang et al. 2020; J. Liu et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2020; Fintelman-Rodrigues et al. 2020; Clementi et al. 2020; Touret et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1038/s41421-020-0156-0][^10.1093/cid/ciaa237][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730][^10.1101/2020.04.04.020925][^10.1101/2020.03.29.014407][^10.1101/2020.04.03.023846] primarily in Vero cells with most EC50s ranging between 1 M and 10 M. Chloroquine has also been shown to reduce mortality in a mouse model of HCoV-OC43 infection (Keyaerts et al. 2009; L. Shen et al. 2019)[^10.1128/AAC.01509-08][^10.1128/JVI.00023-19] but to have minimal if any effects on virus levels in a mouse SARS-CoV model (Barnard et al. 2006)[^10.1177/095632020601700505]. However, despite its in vitro inhibitory activity against influenza and other viruses including dengue, large clinical trials of chloroquine have not shown any clinical benefit suggesting that the modest inhibition of viruses observed in vitro may be cell culture artifacts (Tricou et al. 2010; Paton et al. 2011)[^10.1371/journal.pntd.0000785][^10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70065-2].

The pharmacokinetics of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are also complicated. Based on plasma levels alone, they appear to barely achieve sufficient inhibitory levels in patients receiving standard dosing regimens (Tett et al. 1989; Ducharme and Farinotti 1996; Lim et al. 2009; Garcia-Cremades et al. 2020; Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1111/j.1365-2125.1989.tb03439.x][^10.2165/00003088-199631040-00003][^10.1128/AAC.00339-08][^10.1002/cpt.1856][^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379]. Mefloquine is an antimalarial that also weakly inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Dyall et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2020)[^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730] but which achieves higher plasma levels than chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379].

The clinical relevance of the modest in vitro activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is not supported by published clinical data. Of four open label randomized controlled studies and five observational studies, only one observational study of 80 patients with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections reported any benefit – more rapid virus clearance compared to historical controls – in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (Gautret et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663]. However, questions have been raised about the validity of this study. Of the remaining eight studies, one retrospective observational study of 48 critically ill patients reported that hydroxychloroquine reduced mortality through its anti-inflammatory effects as evidenced by reduced IL6 levels (Yu, Wang, and Li 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.27.20073379]. None of the seven remaining studies, including the four controlled trials, reported benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine and several also highlighted the risk of ventricular arrythmias (Mahevas et al. 2020; Molina et al. 2020; Z. Chen et al. 2020; Borba et al. 2020; W. Tang et al. 2020; J.

Niclosamide is an oral anti-helminthic drug that has been used in millions of persons worldwide. It appears to exert it anti-helminthic effects by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity (J. Xu et al. 2020)[^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00052]. In high-throughput drug repurposing screens, niclosamide has been found to have several additional biological effects that appear to be associated either with its effect on endosomal acidification or with its influence on signaling pathways (W. Chen et al. 2018)[^10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.04.001]. Five research groups reported that niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV (Wen et al. 2007; C.-Y. Wu et al. 2004)[^10.1021/jm070295s][^10.1073/pnas.0403596101], MERS-CoV (Ko et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582], or SARS-CoV-2 (Gassen et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.15.997254][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730] in cell culture with EC50s consistently below 1 M. One study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 facilitates AKT1/SKPT-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 and that reversal of this effect by niclosamide and the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 markedly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 (Gassen et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.15.997254]. Although niclosamide dosing has generally been designed to achieve high intestinal levels, a recent pharmacokinetic review suggested that even at current doses, its maximal plasma concentration may be sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication (Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379].

Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug used in treatment of schizophrenia that has been reported to inhibit several viruses by interfering with the entry of viruses into cells by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Zumla et al. 2016; Yang and Shen 2020)[^10.1038/nrd.2015.37][^10.7150/ijbs.45498]. Four studies have reported EC50s in the range of 1 to 14 M for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Dyall et al. 2014; de Wilde et al. 2014; Cong et al. 2018; Weston et al. 2020)[^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14][^10.1371/journal.pone.0194868][^10.1101/2020.03.25.008482].

K22 is a small molecule found to inhibit the double membrane formation and reticular vesicular network required for the replication of coronaviruses and other positive strand RNA viruses (Lundin et al. 2014; Rappe et al. 2018)[^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004166][^10.1016/j.virusres.2018.01.002]. Although it has weak in vitro activity, it is of interest because it appears to act at novel stage of infection and because K22-resistant viruses containing nsp6 mutations were selected after 10 passages of HCoV-229E suggesting that this compound may also have specific antiviral activity (Lundin et al. 2014)[^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004166].

Conclusion: The early hopes that chloroquine / hydroxychloroquine might be useful for treating SARS-CoV-2 appear to no longer be justified. Despite the low likelihood that these drugs are effective, they have hijacked much of the clinical research agenda. If the few ongoing placebo-controlled studies do not resolve the remaining questions regarding their use, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine may end up becoming the de facto control arm in comparison to newer compounds such as remdesivir and others in this review. Niclosamide now appears more promising than hydroxychloroquine, although questions remain about its bioavailability. A phase I/II trial to evaluate its pharmacokinetics and potential antiviral activity is needed. 

## Miscellaneous Additional Host Targets
Signaling pathway inhibitors: For some viral infections, high-throughput experiments have been performed to identify host proteins essential for virus infection but not cell viability. These have not yet been reported for coronavirus infections. However, several transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have described perturbations in cellular signaling pathways raising the possibility that drugs that influence the kinase proteins involved in these pathways might influence coronavirus replication (Josset et al. 2013; Kindler et al. 2013; Kindrachuk et al. 2015)[^10.1128/mBio.00165-13][^10.1128/mBio.00611-12][^10.1128/AAC.03659-14]. One encyclopedic proteomic SARS-CoV-2 study described the many interactions between virus and host proteins but was not primarily focused on signaling pathways (D. E. Gordon, Jang, Bouhaddou, et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9].

The kinase inhibitors dasatinib and imatinib were found to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with EC50s of 2.1 and 5.4 M for dasatinib and 9.8 and 17.7 M for imatinib (Dyall et al. 2014)[^10.1128/AAC.03036-14]. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses possibly by inhibiting viral fusion with endosomal membranes and demonstrating that inhibition occurs specifically through ABL kinase inhibition

At least one pharmacokinetic study suggested, however, that standard doses of imatinib would be associated with plasma levels considerably lower than the EC50s reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379]. As of April 24, imatinib is listed in four ongoing or planned clinical trials including two placebo-controlled trials. It appears, however, that in these studies imatinib is being studied primarily for its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis. Another kinase inhibitor, saracatinib, has also recently been shown to inhibit several coronaviruses in the low M range (Shin et al. 2018)[^10.3390/v10060283]

Nitazoxanide: Nitazoxanide is licensed in the U.S. for the treatment of cryptosporidium infections. It has been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses in vitro. Its potential mechanisms of antiviral activity are not known. It has been proposed to interfere with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication including those involving interferon or mTORC1 (Rossignol 2016)[^10.1016/j.jiph.2016.04.001]. In one study its EC50 for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.1 M (M. Wang et al. 2020)[^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0]. One pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that nitazoxanide plasma levels could reach concentrations above its one reported EC50 level (Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379]. As of April 24, it is listed as being studied in six clinical trials, including two placebo-controlled studies.

Ciclesonide: Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid discovered in a high-throughput drug screen to inhibit coronavirus replication in the low M range (Matsuyama et al. 2020; Jeon et al. 2020; Ko et al. 2020)[^10.1101/2020.03.11.987016][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582]. Although its mechanism of action is not known, virus passage in the presence of ciclesonide led to the selection of a ciclesonide-resistant mutant, characterized by a point mutation in the NSP15 gene. A single mutation in this gene was responsible for ~100-fold reduced susceptibility. A small case series of three patients from Japan who received inhaled ciclesonide has been published (Iwabuchi et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.jiac.2020.04.007], As of April 21, there is one planned study of inhaled ciclesonide in South Korea.

Interferon inducers: Several compounds appear to inhibit viruses by inducing interferon. Ampligen® is a mismatched double-stranded RNA polymer that stimulates the production of interferon. It has been reported to have in vitro activity against several viruses (Gowen et al. 2007)[^10.4049/jimmunol.178.8.5200] including SARS-CoV (Barnard et al. 2006)[^10.1177/095632020601700505]. It has also been reported to protect mice against SARS-CoV challenge in three studies (Barnard et al. 2006; Day et al. 2009; Kumaki et al. 2017)[^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.virol.2009.09.023][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.12.007]. Hiltonol® is synthetic double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid reported to protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV challenge when administered intranasally prior to infection (Kumaki et al. 2017)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.12.007]. Tilorone is a small molecule reported to inhibit MERS-CoV and other viruses in vitro by inducing interferon (L. Shen et al. 2019; Ekins and Madrid 2020)[^10.1128/JVI.00023-19][^10.1128/AAC.00440-20].

Cyclophilin inhibitors: Cyclosporin and FK-506 are two immunosuppressive drugs commonly used to prevent rejection in transplant recipients. The discovery of these two compounds led to the identification of the family of cyclophilin host proteins that bind to cyclosporin and FK-506. Cyclophilins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including protein folding, protein trafficking, and cell signaling. They have also been shown to play a role in the replication of several viruses including HIV-1, hepatitis C, influenza, and several coronavirus species (de Wilde et al. 2018)[^10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.011]. Alisporivir is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor which has been studied primarily for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. However, these compounds have generally had just weak inhibitory effects of on coronavirus replication and alisporivir did not protect mice from SARS-CoV infection (de Wilde et al. 2011; 2013; 2017; Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2014; H. S. Li et al. 2018; Jeon et al. 2020)[^10.1099/vir.0.034983-0][^10.1099/vir.0.052910-0][^10.1016/j.virusres.2016.11.011][^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.02.010][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.05.007][^10.1101/2020.03.20.999730].

Ivermectin: Ivermectin is one of an increasing number of additional compounds found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 without a defined mechanism of action. It has a reported EC50 of about 2 M (Caly et al. 2020)[^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104787]. Although its plasma levels following oral administration appear too low to inhibit coronavirus replication, its levels in lung tissue appear likely to be higher  (Chaccour et al. 2020; Arshad et al. 2020)[^10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271][^10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379]. Ivermectin is included in four clinical trials – each containing multiple treatment arms.
