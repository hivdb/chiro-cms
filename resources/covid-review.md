## Introduction
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, the development of effective antiviral treatments appeared promising. Since the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV pandemic and MERS-CoV outbreaks, many novel and repurposed compounds have been found to possess anti-coronavirus activity in vitro and it was expected that one or more effective antiviral treatments would be deployed as a useful stopgap measure pending vaccine development [^10.1038/nrd.2015.37][^10.1038/d41573-020-00016-0][^10.1016/j.coviro.2014.06.002][^10.1007/s11684-017-0596-6][^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002][^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300]. One year later, highly effective vaccines have now been introduced and are beginning to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, despite the emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of one nucleoside analog and two monoclonal antibody preparations, antiviral therapy has had little impact on COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

The development of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy, however, remains critical for those awaiting vaccination as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination. Moreover, the ongoing emergence and spread of immune-escape variants means that even immunocompetent persons are likely to have higher rates of vaccine failure than what was observed in clinical trials conducted earlier in the pandemic. Finally, antiviral therapies that target conserved viral proteins are likely to be effective against future pandemic coronaviruses.

Here we review one year of progress in race to develop antiviral therapies for COVID-19. The review summarizes research spanning pre-clinical and clinical drug development efforts with an emphasis on antiviral compounds that are in clinical development or that are high priorities for clinical development. The review is divided into four main largely non-overlapping sections: (1) compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 enzymes including its polymerase and proteases; (2) compounds that inhibit virus entry including monoclonal antibodies; (3) interferons; and (4) repurposed drugs that inhibit host processes required for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

## Polymerase Inhibitors
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA-templated manner. RdRPs are highly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families [^10.3390/v11080745]. Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors are the most common antiviral compounds comprising a plurality of all licensed antivirals. Most antiviral polymerase inhibitors lack a 3’-hydroxyl group and act as nucleoside analog chain terminators. Others contain a 3'-hydroxyl group yet still result in immediate or delayed chain termination. Finally, some nucleoside analogs are incorporated into viral genomes and inhibit replication by introducing mutations during subsequent rounds of virus replication.

Coronavirus RNA polymerization is more complex than that of other viruses. First, coronaviruses contain a 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN; nsp14), which is required for replication fidelity [^10.1073/pnas.0508200103]. ExoN is responsible for the intrinsic resistance of coronavirus species to ribavirin and several other nucleoside analogs [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1003565][^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. Second, coronavirus genomes are three times larger than most other RNA genomes and thus require increased processivity, which may explain why RdRP (nsp12) requires two accessory proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). Third, in addition to copying the full virus genome, the coronavirus RdRP transcribes multiple sub-genomic mRNAs in addition to copying the full virus genome. Several cryo-EM structures of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 replication-transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2 have been published [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.034][^10.1126/science.abb7498][^10.1038/s41586-020-2368-8][^10.1126/science.abc1560].

### Remdesivir
Remdesivir (GS-5734, Veklury) is the monophosphate prodrug of the parent 1’-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside analogue GS-441524 [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01594]. The presence of the phosphate group allows for more efficient metabolism of the prodrug to the active nucleoside triphosphate form by bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step. Remdesivir contains a 3’-OH group and is therefore a non-obligate chain terminator. It causes delayed chain termination due to a steric clash with S861 after the addition of three trailing nucleosides [^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056][^10.1074/jbc.RA120.013679][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.015720][^10.1038/s41467-020-20542-0][^10.1016/j.molcel.2021.01.035]. The fact that chain termination does not occur until additional nucleoside triphosphates have been added explains how remdesivir eludes the coronavirus exonuclease.

Remdesivir has broad spectrum activity against multiple RNA viruses and inhibits SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>s) generally below 1 μM [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883][^10.1128/mBio.00221-18][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940]. It inhibits coronaviruses in multiple cell types including primary human airway epithelial cells and demonstrates a low potential for off-target toxicity in a variety of cellular and biochemical assays [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1128/AAC.02237-20]. Remdesivir reduces lung virus levels and lung damage in mice infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aal3653][^10.1073/pnas.1922083117], and mice and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107940][^10.1038/s41586-020-2423-5]. Remdesivir resistance in a related coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), has arisen during prolonged in vitro passage experiments due to mutations in the RdRP fingers domain [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18]. Introducing the homologous substitutions into SARS-CoV (F480L + V557L) resulted in a virus with reduced replication capability and about 6-fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir [^10.1128/mBio.00221-18].

Remdesivir is administered intravenously with a loading dose of 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily for 5 to 10 days. Following intravenous administration, the achievable maximum remdesivir plasma concentration is predicted to be at least twice as high as its most commonly reported EC<sub>50</sub>s. However, several research groups have argued that remdesivir penetrates poorly into the lungs and that either GS-441524 itself or other GS-441524 prodrugs may be superior to remdesivir [^10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173634][^10.1208/s12248-020-00459-8][^10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00316][^10.1101/2021.02.04.429674][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01929].

As of February 2021, there have been four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir containing a placebo arm [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9][^10.1001/jama.2020.16349] of which two were blinded [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. The NIH Adaptive Covid-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) randomized 1063 persons with severe disease to remdesivir for 10 days versus placebo. Persons receiving remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days vs 15 days for the placebo group (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12-1.49; p<0.001). Kaplan Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% vs. 15.2% at day 29 (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.52-1.03). A subgroup analysis showed that response to therapy was greater in those with less severe disease (i.e., those not requiring supplemental oxygen or receiving oxygen via nasal cannula) than in those with severe disease (i.e., those requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation). These results led to an Emergency Use Authorization and the subsequent approval of remdesivir by the FDA. [^10.1056/NEJMoa2007764][^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9].

However, the open-label WHO Solidarity RCT which included 2750 persons randomized to remdesivir and 4800 to standard-of-care detected no reduction in mortality, requirement for ventilation, or reduction in hospital stay for those receiving remdesivir [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184]. In addition, remdesivir was not associated with reductions in either upper or lower respiratory tract virus load levels in the one study that examined this outcome [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. The fourth RCT compared the remdesivir for 10 days vs. 5 days vs. placebo in persons with moderate disease detected no difference between each of the three arms [^10.1001/jama.2020.16349].

### Molnupiravir
β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) is a cytidine analogue that exerts its activity primarily through viral mutagenesis . It incorporates into new RNA strands and results in the introduction of many mutations during subsequent rounds of replication [^10.1016/j.coviro.2019.04.002][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester (MK-4482 previously known as EIDD-2801) is an orally available NHC prodrug. The fact that molnupiravir is not a chain terminator likely explains the mechanism by which it eludes the proof-reading function of coronavirus exonucleases. Deep sequencing studies have confirmed that viral mutagenesis is the main mechanism by which molnupiravir inhibits coronaviruses [^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. However, there is in vitro evidence that NHC can be metabolized into deoxy-NHC and cause DNA mutations in host cells.

Molnupiravir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 with most EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1 μM [^10.1128/JVI.01348-19][^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883]. It is active in primary human airway epithelial cells and It reduces virus levels, disease, and lung damage in mouse models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [^10.1126/scitranslmed.abb5883][^10.1038/s41586-021-03312-w] and in ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1038/s41564-020-00835-2]. A phase I dose-ranging study of a 5-day course of oral therapy in healthy adults found no evidence of toxicity compared with a placebo group and detected levels that were expected to be efficacious based on animal model studies [^10.1128/aac.02428-20]. A phase II trial examined virological endpoints among persons receiving molnupiravir 200 mg BID, 400 mg BID, 800 mg BID versus placebo in 176 nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients with fever and/or signs of a respiratory illness (NCT04405570). Among 78 patients with positive baseline cultures, 6/25 (24%) placebo patients versus 0/47 pooled molnupiravir patients (p=0.001) had positive cultures at day 5 [^10.1038/s41586-021-03312-w]. Two large phase II/III trials in hospitalized (NCT04575584) and nonhospitalized (NCT04575597) patients with COVID-19 began in October 2020. Molnupiravir is not being studied in pregnant women or women who might become pregnant because of its mutagenic potential [^10.1128/AAC.01652-20].

### Other Nucleoside Analogs
AT-527 is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug of AT-511 that has been previously studied for the treatment of HCV. It inhibits SARS-CoV-2 with EC90 of about 0.5 M in human airway epithelial cells [^10.1371/journal.pone.0227104][^10.1128/AAC.01201-19][^10.1128/AAC.02479-20]. The mechanism by which it retains activity in the face of coronavirus exonuclease activity has not been reported. AT-527 is being evaluated in two phase II placebo-controlled trials of patients with mild-to-moderate disease (NCT04396106 and NCT04709835).

Favipiravir (T-705) is a purine analog prodrug that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form the active metabolite ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (aka T-705-RTP). It has broad spectrum activity against multiple viral RNA polymerases and appears to act by causing viral mutagenesis [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.09.015][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.03.003][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1002/cpt.1844]. However, it demonstrates little inhibitory activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 60 to >100 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1038/s41467-020-18463-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7] consistent with a low rate of favipiravir-RTP incorporation into the RdRP catalytic site [^10.1073/pnas.2021946118]. It is active in a hamster model only when used at high doses [^10.1073/pnas.2014441117]. Several small open-label randomized studies have demonstrated little or no clinical or virological benefit associated with its use [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.142][^10.1128/AAC.01897-20][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1176][^10.1016/j.ejps.2020.105631].

The FDA-approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog sofosbuvir is being studied in several COVID-19 clinical trials. Although it has reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in biochemical studies [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104857][^10.1038/s41598-020-73641-9][^10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00392], it has little or no inhibitory activity in cell culture [^10.1038/s41467-020-19055-7][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411]. One patient-level meta-analysis of three open-label studies totaling 176 patients reported that clinical recovery within 14 days was significantly greater among patients receiving sofosbuvir plus daclastavir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor) than among those receiving standard of care [^10.1093/jac/dkaa418]. If this preliminary finding is validated, it is likely that the response is due to the fact that daclastavir itself has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, although the mechanism for this activity is not known [^10.1101/2020.06.15.153411].

Although ribavirin 5’-monophosphate can be incorporated during RNA synthesis, it is readily excised by the coronavirus exonuclease [^10.1073/pnas.1718806115]. As a result ribavirin has little, if any, in vitro or in vivo activity against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.virol.2009.09.023][^10.1128/AAC.01652-20][^10.1371/journal.pmed.0030343][^10.1038/srep01686].

## Protease Inhibitors
Coronaviruses contain two protease enzymes: 3 chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro or Main Mpro; non-structural protein 5 \[nsp5\]) and papain-like serine protease (PLpro; nsp3). Mpro cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at 11 sites. It is conserved among several families of RNA viruses and its cleavage site specificity is similar to the picornavirus family of 3C proteases. Mpro contains 306 amino acids and functions as a homodimer. It shares 96% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV Mpro. PLpro is part of a 1,922 amino acid multidomain transmembrane protein. It cleaves polyprotein 1a/b at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 boundaries and several host proteins important for innate immunity such as ubiquitin interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG-15).

There are more candidate Mpro inhibitors than PLpro inhibitors because of this enzyme’s similarities to proteases of other virus species and because Mpro is smaller, less complicated, and easier to produce in large quantities [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140]. Although there have been more than 100 published Mpro structures, only a limited number of PLpro structures have been published [^10.1016/j.drudis.2020.12.005][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140][^10.1038/s41467-021-21060-3][^10.15252/embj.2020106275]. Although HIV-1 protease inhibitors were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic, they possess either little or no anti-coronavirus activity in biochemical and cell culture studies [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1128/AAC.00825-20][^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.085], animal models [^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6][^10.1128/mBio.01114-20], and clinical trials [^10.1056/NEJMoa2001282][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1056/NEJMoa2015294].

Drug screens and structure-based designs targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that have identified a variety of compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 biochemically and in cell culture with IC50s and EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 0.01 to 1 μM. These compounds belong to several families of reversible and covalently binding irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitors, many of which have been co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [^10.1126/science.abb3405][^10.1126/science.abb4489][^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y][^10.3390/v13020174][^10.1128/mBio.01833-20][^10.1038/s41467-021-20900-6][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01063][^10.1016/j.str.2020.10.007]. These compounds are of interest as chemical scaffolds for potential therapeutic agents. However, protease inhibitor development faces several challenges. First, some of these compounds may not be sufficiently selective for Mpro, increasing their risk of off-target effects [^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00815][^33813272]. Second, most current inhibitors bind Mpro covalently. Although these are more readily identifiable, covalently binding inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of toxicity [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01140].

PF-00835231 is among the most potent investigational Mpro inhibitors. It has an IC50 in enzymatic assays of 0.0003 μM and an EC<sub>50</sub> in cell culture of 0.2 μM [^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01063][^10.1128/JVI.01819-20]. It has undergone safety studies and pharmacokinetic profiling in rats, dogs, and monkeys [^10.1101/2020.09.12.293498]. PF-07304814 is an intravenously administered phosphate PF-00835231 prodrug that is being studied in a phase I trial of hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease (NCT04535167).

Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium drug molecule with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that has been studied for the treatment of a variety of illnesses. It was found to inhibit Mpro in a high-throughput drug screen and to have IC50s in biochemical assays and EC<sub>50</sub>s in cell culture assays of about 1 μM [^10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y]. It appears to inhibit Mpro allosterically [^10.1126/sciadv.abd0345] and to also inhibit PLpro [^10.1101/2020.08.30.273979][^10.1038/s41598-021-83229-6]. It is being studied as an oral drug in two small phase II placebo-controlled trials of persons with mild-to-moderate and severe COVID-19 infections.

GC376 has been effectively used for treating cats with the rapidly fatal coronavirus disease FIPV [^10.1371/journal.ppat.1005531]. It forms covalent bonds with the Mpro active site cysteine and inhibits multiple coronaviruses [^10.1128/JVI.01348-12]. Its SARS-CoV-2 Mpro IC50 ranges from 0.03 to 1.5 μM while its cell culture EC<sub>50</sub> ranges from 0.2 to 3.4 μM [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1038/s41467-020-18096-2][^10.1101/2020.06.07.138677][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x]. GC376 is considered a promising compound for further development [^10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.004][^10.1101/2020.08.03.235291][^10.1126/sciadv.abe0751].

The approved HCV protease inhibitor boceprevir displays inhibits Mpro biochemically and in cell culture and is also considered a promising compound for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection [^10.1038/s41422-020-0356-z][^10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00521][^10.1038/s41467-020-18233-x][^10.1126/science.abf1611][^10.1016/j.str.2020.10.007]

## Entry Inhibitors
The spike glycoprotein is responsible for attachment to host cells and for fusion of viral and cellular membranes. It is a trimer comprising three identical subunits. Each monomer has an exposed S1 attachment domain and a partially hidden S2 fusion domain. The receptor binding domain (RBD), which is part of S1, alternates between a closed/down position and an open/up position that enables it to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1126/science.abb2507]. S1 binding occurs on the outer surface of ACE2 whereas angiotensin substrates bind in a deep cleft containing the active site [^10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045][^10.1038/s41586-020-2179-y][^33277323]. RBD-ACE2 binding results in structural changes that lead to S1 dissolution, S2 exposure, and virus-cell fusion.

The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is required for the virus spike to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. The spike protein has two cleavage sites: one at the S1/S2 boundary and one within S2 referred to as S2’. The sequences of coronavirus spike cleavage sites, the host enzymes required for their cleavage, and the cellular locations where cleavage occurs influence cell tropism and transmissibility [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/bs.aivir.2019.08.002]. For SARS-CoV-2, the S1/S2 cleavage site is a polybasic furin site that appears to be post-translationally cleaved during viral biosynthesis [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104742][^10.1038/s41586-020-2772-0][^10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108254][^10.1038/s41586-021-03237-4][^10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.022]. Cleavage of S2 at the S2’ site is carried out by the host protease cathepsin B/L within endosomes and by TMPRSS2 at the plasma membrane. Accumulating data suggest that TMPRSS2-mediated S2’ cleavage is more important for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion whereas endosomal cathepsins may have been relatively more important for SARS-CoV-1 [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1073/pnas.0505577102].

S2 contains a fusion peptide and two complementary heptad repeat (HR) regions – designated HR1 and HR2 – which are alpha helices with repeated patterns of seven amino acids. HR1 and HR2 are complementary allowing them to bind to one other. After RBD-ACE2 binding, the fusion peptide inserts into the host cell membrane. The three HR1 domains then associate with the three HR2 domains to create a six-helix bundle which creates a hairpin that brings the viral and host cell membranes together [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792][^10.1007/s13238-020-00806-7].

### Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
Neutralizing mAbs can block the entry of virus into host cells and recruit host effector pathways to destroy virus-infected cells. Neutralizing mAbs are effective at preventing or treating multiple viral infections including those caused by respiratory syncytial virus [^10.1038/s41579-019-0149-x][^10.1016/j.prrv.2018.12.001], influenza [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104562], Ebola virus [^10.1056/NEJMoa1910993], and MERS-CoV [^10.1093/infdis/jiab036]. The presence of neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD have correlated with protection in animal models and in previously infected and vaccinated persons, although cellular immune responses and potentially non-neutralizing Abs are likely to have contributed to protection in these studies [^10.1126/science.abc4776][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035389][^10.1056/NEJMoa2034577][^10.1056/NEJMoa2027906][^10.1038/s41586-020-2814-7][^10.1016/j.immuni.2020.07.020][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.015][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002]. Paradoxically, the highest levels of neutralizing Abs levels are detected in patients experiencing severe COVID-19 infections [^10.1038/s41591-020-0897-1][^10.1038/s41586-020-2456-9][^10.1371/journal.pone.0236905][^10.1093/cid/ciaa344], suggesting that they may play a protective role in patients for whom more rapid immunologic responses to infection fail to prevent severe disease [^10.1038/s41577-020-0359-5][^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1101/2020.12.18.20248331]. The most common neutralizing Abs emerging in patients target the S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) [^10.1172/JCI142804][^10.1126/sciimmunol.abc8413][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.037][^10.1101/2020.08.21.261727].

Neutralizing mAbs have been isolated most commonly from the memory B cells of persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2, from immunized transgenic mice, and from combinatorial protein display libraries (https://covdb.stanford.edu/page/mab-tables/) [^10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa739]. Regardless of their source, Ab-producing cells are screened for their ability to bind either the S trimer or just the RBD. The most potent SARS-CoV-2 mAbs have IC50s between 1 to 15 ng/ml. As standard mAbs have a molecular weight of 150 kDa, an IC50 below 150 ng/ml indicates picomolar activity.

Although no two mAbs share identical epitopes, those binding the RBD are usually classified according to where on the RBD they bind. Two main classes of mAbs bind the ACE2-binding region of the RBD referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM), and two classes bind a separate part of the RBD referred to as the RBD core [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.10.012][^10.1038/s41586-020-2852-1][^10.3390/v13010134]. The RBD core is more evolutionarily conserved than the ACE2-binding residues in the RBM and mAbs that bind this region can often neutralize SARS-CoV and other SARS-related coronaviruses [^10.1038/s41467-020-16256-y][^10.1126/science.abb7269][^10.1038/s41594-020-0480-y][^10.1126/science.abc7424][^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y]. However, non-ACE2-competing mAbs are usually somewhat less inhibitory than those that compete with ACE2 binding. Several laboratories have described potent mAbs that recognize the S1 N-terminal domain rather than the RBD [^10.1126/science.abc6952][^10.1038/s41586-020-2571-7]. In macaques, hamsters, and various mouse models, the administration of neutralizing mAbs shortly before or after infection with SARS-CoV-2 has consistently resulted in reduced respiratory tract virus levels and signs of illness.

Five mAb preparations are in phase III trials. Four of these are mAb combinations including casirivimab (CAS) + imdevimab (IMD) [^10.1126/science.abd0827][^10.1126/science.abe2402][^10.1126/science.abd0831],  bamlanivimab (BAM) + etesevimab (ETE) [^10.1101/2020.09.30.318972][^10.1038/s41586-020-2381-y], cilgavimab (COV2-2130) + tixagevimab (COV2-2196) [^10.1038/s41586-020-2548-6], and BRII-196 + BRII-198. Three are single mAb agents including sotrovimab (VIR-7831) [^10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y], regdanvimab (CT-P59) [^10.1038/s41467-020-20602-5], and TY027. More than 10 additional mAb preparations are in phase I/II trials (https://covdb.stanford.edu/clinical-trials/#Entry%20(monoclonal%20antibodies)) [^10.1093/abt/tbaa020][^10.1080/19420862.2020.1854149]. Three mAb preparations have received FDA EUAs including BAM monotherapy, BAM+ETE, and CAS+IMD for use in non-hospitalized patients at high-risk of severe COVID-19 illness. However, because of an increasing number of reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are resistant to bamlanivimab alone, FDA has recently revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy.

There are currently ten studies of mAb preparations that have either been published [^10.1056/NEJMoa2029849][^10.1056/NEJMoa2033130][^10.1056/NEJMoa2035002][^10.1001/jama.2021.0202], presented at a scientific meeting, or announced in a press release. BAM+ETE, CAS+IMD (https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/phase-3-trial-shows-regen-covtm-casirivimab-imdevimab-antibody), and Vir-7831 (https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/vir-biotechnology-and-gsk-announce-vir-7831-reduces-hospitalisation-and-risk-of-death-in-early-treatment-of-adults-with-covid-19/) have been reported to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in non-hospitalized persons. BAM and CAS+IMD have been reported to reduce the risk of symptomatic and/or overall infection in persons at high risk of infection. BAM was studied in nursing home residents and staff while CAS+IMD was studied in household contacts of infected persons. A study of BAM in hospitalized patients was terminated prematurely as an interim analysis pointed to the unlikelihood of achieving benefit [^10.1056/NEJMoa2033130]. In contrast, the study of CAS+IMD in hospitalized patients on low-flow oxygen was allowed to continue as this combination demonstrated virological benefit in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients (https://investor.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/regeneron-announces-encouraging-initial-data-covid-19-antibody).

Each of the three mAb preparations with an FDA EUA are active in vitro against the most commonly circulating variant of concern B.1.1.7 which contains the RBD mutation N501Y. However, both BAM and the BAM+ETE combination are inactive in vitro against the other two variants of concern – B.1.351 and P.1 – which contain N501Y in combination with E484K and K417N/T. In contrast, IMD retains activity against these two variants. BAM (but not ETE) is also inactive against the widely circulating U.S. variant which contains L452R. Like CAS+IMD, the combination of cilgavimab + tixagevimab appears to retain activity against each of the three variants of concern. Sotrovimab is active against all three variants of concern; however, its maximal percent inhibition of B.1.1.7 appears to be below 90% [^33705729][^10.1101/2021.03.09.434607].

### Single domain antibodies (sdAbs)
Single-domain Abs (sdAbs) are heavy-chain only antibodies that occur naturally in camelids, which are increasingly being  developed as potential therapeutics [^10.3389/fimmu.2017.01802][^10.1016/j.tim.2020.12.006]. They are identified by screening protein display libraries created from the B cells of immunized or non-immunized camelids as well as from synthetic variable heavy chain libraries [^10.1016/j.tim.2020.12.006]. sdAbs are easier to manufacture then standard mAbs because they can be expressed in bacterial or yeast cells. They can also often be delivered by inhalation. Although they are generally less potent than complete mAbs, their activity can be increased when engineered in multimeric forms. Many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing sdAbs have been isolated [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.031][^10.1126/science.abe3255][^10.1038/s41467-020-19204-y][^10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5][^10.1038/s41589-020-00679-1][^10.1126/science.abe4747][^10.1038/s41594-020-0469-6][^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.023][^10.1073/pnas.2010197117][^10.1126/science.abe6230], and several have demonstrated efficacy in animal models [^10.1073/pnas.2010197117][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.007]. However, none are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial.

### Convalescent plasma and polyclonal antibody preparations
There have been one large observational trial and several open label and placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials of convalescent plasma. In the subset of patients in the observational trial that received units with known anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, mortality was inversely proportional to antibody titer: 115 of 515 patients (22.3%) in the high-titer group, 549 of 2006 patients (27.4%) in the medium-titer group, and 166 of 561 patients (29.6%) in the low-titer group. The benefit of high titer convalescent plasma, however, was observed only among those not receiving mechanical ventilation. Among the randomized controlled trials, there was generally no benefit associated with convalescent plasma [^10.1056/NEJMoa2031304] with the exception of one trial in which high-risk patients older than 75 were treated within 72 hours of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms [^10.1056/NEJMoa2033700]. In this trial, the risk of progression to severe disease was reduced in those receiving convalescent plasma: 13 of 80 (16%) versus 25 of 80 (31%); relative risk = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.94; p=0.03).

Polyclonal antibody preparations are expected to be less expensive than mAb preparations, although they will have a lower mean binding affinity [^10.3390/life11020144]. Several clinical trials are evaluating hyperimmune polyclonal antibody preparations including IgG fractionated from convalescent patients with high neutralization antibody titers [^10.1101/2021.03.19.436183] and the more scalable solution of IgG fractionated from immunized animals. The polyclonal antibody preparations from immunized animals include purified equine F(ab)2 preparations (INM005) [^10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100843], swine glyco-humanized IgG (XAV-19) [^10.1101/2021.04.15.21255549], and bovine transchromosomic IgG (SAB-185). Each of these technologies has been shown in phase 1 and 2 human trials to avoid the risk of serum sickness reactions [^10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100843][^10.1101/2021.04.15.21255549][^10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30002-1].

### Fusion inhibitors
Peptides that mimic HR2 can block virus-cell fusion by preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2. Several peptide mimics of coronavirus HR2 have been shown to potently inhibit infection with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.046][^10.1093/infdis/jiv325][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792][^10.1038/ncomms4067][^10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00890][^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580][^10.1128/JVI.00635-20]. Interest in coronavirus fusion inhibitors is partly motivated by the high degree of conservation among S2 subunits. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S2 differ in about 10% of their amino acids overall, their HR1 domains differ by only 7% and their HR2 domains are essentially identical [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x].

Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an HR2-mimicking peptide, EK1, was identified as a potential broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor because it inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at sub-micromolar levels and was safe and protective against MERS-CoV when administered intranasally to mice [^10.1126/sciadv.aav4580]. Based on SARS-CoV-2 structural studies, several EK1 amino acid modifications were made and a cholesterol group was added [^10.1038/s41422-020-0305-x] to improve its pharmacokinetic and inhibitory activity [^10.1128/JVI.00288-17]. This new lipopeptide, named EK1C4 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 fusion about 150 times more potently than EK1, resulting in an EC<sub>50</sub> of 0.04 μM.

Several additional highly potent HR2-mimicking SARS-Cov-2 fusion inhibitors have been described including IPB02 and IPB04 [^10.1128/JVI.00635-20], HRC-lipoprotein-SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/mBio.01935-20], and the dimeric lipoprotein \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol [^33597220]. Intranasal administration of \[SARS-HRC-PEG4\]-2-chol to ferrets completely protected them from infection while co-housed with other infected ferrets [^10.1126/science.abf4896]. However, there are currently no clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.

### Soluble ACE2 and other molecular decoys
The approximately 750 amino acid soluble recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) protects lungs from injury during the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^10.1007/s00018-007-6228-6][^10.1038/nm1267][^10.1186/s13054-017-1823-x][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004]. It is safe in human subjects [^10.1007/s40262-013-0072-7] and it was being developed as an ARDS treatment prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It inhibits the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2-expressing cells [^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.05.114][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045] and also appears to prevent the loss of lung protective effects associated with the internalization of ACE2 following SARS-CoV-2 binding. Although ACE2 mimics cannot recruit immune cells, they can potentially bind to SARS-CoV-2 as tightly as mAbs and can be easier to manufacture as they do not require expression in mammalian cells.

Several research groups have shown that rhACE2 and proteins designed to mimic the ACE2 ectodomain are highly potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in cell culture and in pseudovirus entry experiments. Several strategies have been employed to create even more-potent and smaller ACE2 mimics by identifying only those ACE2 regions that contribute most strongly to RBD binding [^10.1016/j.virol.2006.01.029][^10.1126/science.abe0075][^10.1126/science.abd9909][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117]. ACE2 mimics have also been fused to Ig Fc domains and to scaffolds to create bivalent or trivalent inhibitors [^10.1038/s41467-020-16048-4][^10.1128/mBio.02451-20][^10.1073/pnas.2016093117][^10.1038/s41594-020-00549-3][^10.1126/sciadv.abf1738][^10.1126/science.abc0870]. Modified ACE2-mimics have been designed that bind in vitro to a high proportion of SARS-related coronavirus spike proteins and might be expected to bind to currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants [^10.1126/sciadv.abf1738]. CTC-445.2d is a dimeric ACE2 mimic that has been shown to protect SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters from weight loss and death [^10.1126/science.abe0075].

APN1 (Apeiron Biologics), a clinical grade soluble rhACE2 [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.004] that has demonstrated safety in 89 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients and volunteers and is now being evaluated in a 200-person placebo-controlled study of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients (NCT04335136). A press release from Apeiron Biologics announced that preliminary data from this trial showed that persons receiving APN1 experienced reductions in virus load and required mechanical ventilation for fewer days than those receiving placebo (Apeiron Biologics 2021).

### Glycosaminoglycan attachment inhibitors
Glycosaminoglycans are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells and they serve as attachment sites for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses [^10.1371/journal.pone.0023710][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.033][^10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106118]. Several compounds that inhibit the interaction between gylcosaminoglycans and viruses have antiviral activity, including lactoferrin and the anticoagulants heparin and enoxaparin [^10.1080/22221751.2021.1888660][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.033][^10.1128/JVI.01987-20][^10.1055/s-0040-1721319][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104873]. The intranasal administration of heparin has been proposed as a possible way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 after initial infection without increasing the risk of bleeding [^10.1128/JVI.01987-20], and  heparin and enoxaparin are being studied in clinical trials as both anticoagulants and potential attachment inhibitors.

## Interferons
In response to cellular changes suggestive of a viral infection, interferons (IFNs) induce many IFN-stimulated genes encoding proteins that inhibit viral replication by slowing cellular metabolism, interfering with the membrane formation required for virus replication, and inducing cytokines that promote adaptive immunity [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104791]. Although there are three IFN families [^10.1038/nri3787], the innate immune sensing of viral nucleic acids leads specifically to the production of type I and type III IFNs [^10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.008]. Type I IFNs include 13 related IFN-α subtypes, IFN-β, and several poorly defined single gene products including IFN-ε, IFN-κ and IFN-ω. Type III IFN consists of IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3. Although both type I and type III IFNs activate the same dominant JAK-STAT signaling pathway, their cognate receptor expression differs; receptors for type I IFN have near ubiquitous expression throughout the mammalian host, whereas type III IFN receptors are largely thought to be confined to tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [^10.1016/j.immuni.2019.03.025].

The importance of IFNs for combatting SARS-CoV-2 is underscored by the fact that many viruses, particularly coronaviruses, encode multiple proteins that antagonize cellular IFN signaling pathways [^10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81][^10.1016/j.smim.2019.101300][^10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.004][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1008737]. The finding that about 10% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 have neutralizing type I IFN autoantibodies [^10.1126/science.abd4585] supports a role for IFNs in protection against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a reduced IFN response in some studies [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.026][^10.1126/science.abc6027] and an increased response in other studies [^10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.017]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to increase ACE2 expression in upper airway cells [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.035].

IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ each demonstrate inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations of 100-1000 IU/ml in Vero and Calu3 cell lines and in primary human alveolar cells [^10.1128/JVI.01410-20][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104811][^10.1074/jbc.AC120.013788][^10.1128/JVI.00985-20][^10.1128/mBio.01928-20]. IFN-α and IFN-β have demonstrated protective effects against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in mice [^10.1177/095632020601700505][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.11.007] and macaques [^10.1038/nm1001][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1000756][^10.1038/srep01686], while IFN-λ has demonstrated protective effects against SARS-CoV-2 in mice [^10.1038/s41586-020-2708-8]. Several studies, however, have reported worse outcomes in mouse models of SARS and MERS with delayed administration of type I IFNs [^10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.007][^10.1172/JCI126363][^10.1038/s41467-019-13940-6].

There has been one phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial of a nebulized IFN-β preparation SNG001 in non-ventilated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving supplementary oxygen [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7], two phase II randomized placebo-controlled trials of subcutaneous IFN-λ in outpatients with mild disease [^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098][^33785743], two randomized open-label trials of IFN-β including the SOLIDARITY trial [^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.1128/AAC.01061-20], one open-label trial of IFN-α [^10.1016/j.ijid.2020.07.053], and one open-label trial of IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4]. Nebulized IFN-β was found to be associated with an improved outcome, as 6 of 48 patients in the IFN group vs. 11 of 51 patients in the placebo group developed severe disease or died [^10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30511-7]. The larger of two Phase II IFN-λ studies showed no virological benefit in outpatients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection [^10.1038/s41467-021-22177-1], whereas the smaller study reported lower virus loads at day 7 [^33785743][^10.1101/2020.11.09.20228098]. Among the open-label trials, the strongest signal of efficacy was a shorter time to viral clearance and more rapid clinical improvement in patients receiving IFN-β combined with lopinavir/r and ribavirin [^10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4].

There is currently one ongoing phase III trial for inhaled SNG001 (IFN-β; EUCTR2020-004743-83-GB) and one planned study for inhaled Novaferon (IFN-α) in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (NCT04669015). Subcutaneous IFN-λ is being studied in a third phase II trial of outpatients (NCT04344600). The NIH treatment guidelines panel recommends against the use of IFNs for the treatment of severely ill patients with COVID-19 but provide no recommendation for the use of IFNs in earlier disease.

## Host-Targeting Compounds
Repurposed drugs that have been approved or are being studied for other indications often target host processes that influence viral replication. Such host-targeting compounds may be able to inhibit multiple viruses, since different viruses often depend on similar host factors and pathways. Although such compounds may have a higher risk of toxicity than those specifically targeting a virus protein, such toxicity may be acceptable for the relatively short time required to treat an acute infection. Many host-targeting compounds that inhibit coronaviruses in vitro have been identified. They may act by inhibiting a cellular protein, influencing a signaling pathway, or modifying a cellular organelle. However, for many inhibitory compounds, the mechanism of action is not known. This section reviews compounds that appear to act primarily by influencing the host rather than the virus and that have favorable safety profiles.

### Host protease inhibitors
The proteolytic activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases is required for the virus spike to transition from receptor attachment to cell fusion. These proteases include cell surface proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and other related transmembrane serine proteases, furin, and endosomal cathepsins [^10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.021][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104792]. Accumulating data suggest that furin and TMPRSS2 mediate cleavage at the S1/S2 and S2’ sites of SAFS-CoV-2, respectively [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786]. The endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B and L appear to be less important for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV [^10.1073/pnas.0505577102][^10.1128/JVI.00094-12][^10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.012][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]

Camostat and nafamostat are serine protease inhibitors used in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. They inhibit TMPRSS2 in biochemical assays and coronaviruses in cell culture [^33676899][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. In Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells, camostat inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with EC<sub>50</sub>s generally below 1 μM, while the EC<sub>50</sub>s for nafamostat are generally about 10-fold lower [^10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052][^10.1128/AAC.00754-20][^10.3390/v12060629][^10.1101/2020.04.03.024257]. These compounds, however, are largely inactive in Vero cells because Vero cells do not require TMPRSS2 for virus entry [^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.26508/lsa.202000786][^10.3390/v12060629]. Camostat has protected mice from fatal SARS-CoV infection [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011]. It is rapidly converted into the active metabolite GBPA [^33676899][^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106].

In a phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial of 205 patients hospitalized for 48 hours randomized 2:1 to receive camostat 200 mg orally three times daily or placebo, the median time to a 2-point improvement on a 7-point ordinal scale (the primary endpoint) was five days in both arms [^10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100849]. The proportion of patients dying or requiring mechanical ventilation was 10% in the camostat arm and 18% in the placebo arm (secondary endpoint; OR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.25 to 1.18; p = 0.1).  Among those with paired samples, the reduction in virus levels between the camostat and placebo arms were not different. Camostat is currently being studied in several additional phase 2 and 3 trials totaling about 2,500 patients at doses ranging from 600 mg to 2400 mg per day. Nafamostat is associated with higher risk of toxicity compared with camostat and was associated with hyperkalemia in four consecutive critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 [^10.12998/wjcc.v8.i21.5320]. Nafamostat is being studied in three small open-label trials.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) is an endogenous protease inhibitor used as a treatment for persons with severe α1-AT insufficiency. It has been reported to inhibit TMPRSS2 biochemically [^10.1101/2020.05.04.077826] and to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in two studies [^10.1101/2020.08.14.248880][^33741941] but not in a third study [^10.3390/cells9112377]. α1-AT is being studied in at least three placebo-controlled trials of hospitalized non-ICU patients [^10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00018-7]. Aprotinin is a 58 amino acid serine protease inhibitor that inhibits SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with an EC<sub>50</sub> of about 1 μM [^10.3390/cells9112377]. It has been used in Russia intravenously and inhalationally for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. There is one small ongoing open-label trial examining the response to intravenous and inhalational aprotinin (NCT04527133). Bromehexine is an oral mucolytic that has been identified as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor in a high-throughput screen for the treatment of prostate cancer [^10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-1010]. However, it did not inhibit TMPRSS2 in a more recent biochemical study [^10.1021/acsptsci.0c00106]. Neither bromehexine nor its metabolite ambroxol have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.25.221135]. However, in a randomized open-label trial of 78 patients, oral administration was reported to significantly reduce ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and death [^10.34172/bi.2020.27].

### Nucleotide and protein synthesis inhibitors

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway and its inhibition limits the availability of nucleoside triphosphates required for viral replication [^https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13366]. DHODH inhibitors have also been used to treat autoimmune diseases, organ rejection, and cancer. Leflunomide is a DHODH inhibitor licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Its active metabolite teriflunomide, has weak in vitro SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity [^10.1007/s13238-020-00768-w]. However, leflunomide did not reduce viral clearance in an randomized open-label trial of 50 patients with prolonged post-symptomatic viral shedding (Mengmei Wang et al. n.d.)[^10.1093/cid/ciaa1417]. Brequinar is a licensed DHODH inhibitor that appears to have greater activity than leflunomide in vitro [^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. PTC299 is an investigational DHODH inhibitor which has an EC<sub>50</sub> in the low nanomolar range and a high selectivity index [^10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198246]. It is an oral drug that is being developed for oncological indications. A phase II placebo-controlled trial of PTC299 in 380 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 began in July (NCT04439071). IMU-838 is another investigational DHODH inhibitor [^10.3390/v12121394] being studied in a phase II placebo-controlled trial of 230 patients (NCT04379271).

Plitidepsin is an inhibitor of eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1A and it has limited clinical approval for the treatment of multiple myeloma. eEF1A has been shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 and plitidepsin has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting eEF1A. It has an EC90 of 3 nM in pneumocyte-like cells and a selectivity index of 40 [^10.1126/science.abf4058]. It has comparable activity to remdesivir in a mouse model [^10.1126/science.abf4058]. A phase I trial of intravenous plitidepsin in COVID-19 patients has been completed (NCT04382066) and a phase III trial in hospitalized patients with moderate disease is planned (NCT04784559).

### Endosomal trafficking inhibitors
Apilimod inhibits the intracellular trafficking of several viruses including SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of virus replication. It inhibits a kinase enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) involved in endosomal membrane formation. Although it does not alter the pH of endosomes or inhibit cathepsin B or L, it blocks entry of multiple viruses in both pseudovirus entry experiments and in cell culture assays [^10.1073/pnas.2007837117][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. In two large scale screening assays, apilimod was found to have EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging from 10 to 90 nM [^10.1038/s41586-020-2577-1][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.034]. It is an investigational compound that has been studied in human clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Apilimod is being studied in a phase II trial for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (NCT04446377).

Chloroquine analogs are weak bases that, in their non-protonated form, concentrate within acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and interfere with the trafficking of viruses that require a pH-dependent step for entry into the cytoplasm [^10.1016/s1473-3099(03)00806-5][^10.1371/journal.ppat.1004502]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have modest in vitro activity against MERS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], SARS-CoV [^10.1186/1743-422X-2-69][^10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.085][^10.1128/AAC.03011-14], and SARS-CoV-2 [^10.1128/JVI.01218-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1038/s41598-020-70143-6] with most EC<sub>50</sub>s ranging between 1-10 μM in Vero cells, and higher in other cell lines. However, multiple large randomized placebo-controlled [^10.1056/NEJMoa2022926][^10.1056/NEJMoa2023184][^10.7326/M20-4207][^10.1038/s41467-021-22446-z] and open-label trials [^10.1056/NEJMoa2019014][^10.1136/bmj.m1849][^10.1093/cid/ciaa1009] showed no clinical or virological benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Two additional randomized trials showed that hydroxychloroquine was also ineffective for post-exposure prophylaxis [^10.1056/NEJMoa2016638][^10.1056/NEJMoa2021801]. Two factors likely explain the lack of clinical efficacy of chloroquine analogs. First, cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in lung cells, depends primarily on the membrane-based enzyme TMPRSS2 rather than on endosomal fusion and acidification making it likely that the weak in vitro activity observed in Vero cells was not clinically relevant [^10.1038/s41586-020-2575-3][^10.1038/s41467-020-15562-9]. Second, even at high dosages, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may not achieve the drug levels required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

### Inhibitors acting by uncertain mechanisms
Niclosamide is an oral anti-helminthic that exerts its antiparasitic effects by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and stimulating mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase activity [^10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00052]. In high-throughput drug repurposing screens, niclosamide has been found to have additional biological effects that appear to be associated either with an effect on endosomal acidification, preventing the disruption of autophagy, or inhibiting syncytia formation [^10.1016/j.cellsig.2017.04.001][^10.1101/2020.04.15.997254][^10.1038/s41586-021-03491-6]. Niclosamide was also the most active inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 syncytia formation in a high throughput screen of 3000 approved drugs, suppressing the activity of TMEM16/Anoctamin6, a calcium-activated ion channel and the scramblases responsible for phosphatidylserine cell-surface exposure [^10.1038/s41586-021-03491-6]. Niclosamide inhibits SARS-CoV [^10.1128/AAC.48.7.2693-2696.2004][^10.1021/jm070295s], MERS-CoV [^10.1101/2020.09.24.310490], and SARS CoV-2 in cell culture with EC<sub>50</sub>s consistently below 1 μM predominantly in Vero cells. Oral, inhalational, and injectable formulations of niclosamide are being studied in several ongoing or planned randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Clofazimine is an anti-leprosy drug discovered to have anti-coronavirus activity in two high-throughput drug screens. It has been shown to reduce lung virus loads in Syrian Hamsters [^10.1038/s41586-020-2577-1][^10.3389/fimmu.2020.586572][^10.1038/s41586-021-03431-4]. One study suggests that, in a manner similar to niclosamide, it inhibits the calcium channel pathways required for syncytia formation [^10.1038/s41586-021-03491-6].

Nitazoxanide is licensed for the treatment of cryptosporidium infections. It has been reported to inhibit a wide range of viruses in vitro by interfering with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication including those involving interferon or mTORC1 [^10.1016/j.jiph.2016.04.001]. It has also been reported to interfere with SARS-CoV-2-associated syncytia formation [^10.1101/2021.04.12.439201]. The EC<sub>50</sub> for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells is reported to be about 1 to 5 μM [^10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0][^10.1101/2020.07.09.196337]. In two randomized placebo-controlled trials of nearly 800 outpatients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections, nitazoxanide did not influence time to symptom resolution [^10.1183/13993003.03725-2020][^10.1101/2021.04.19.21255441] but one trial reported that those receiving nitazoxanide had slightly more rapid virus load reductions [^10.1183/13993003.03725-2020] and the other reported that those receiving nitazoxanide had a non-statistically significant reduction in progression to severe disease [^10.1101/2021.04.19.21255441].

Emetine is an FDA-approved drug for treating amebiasis. It has been shown to inhibit multiple coronaviruses in vitro including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, with EC<sub>50</sub>s below 1.0 μM [^10.1128/AAC.03036-14][^10.1128/JVI.00023-19][^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582]. Its mechanism of action is uncertain, although it did inhibit MERS-CoV in an entry inhibitor assay using a pseudotype virus expressing S protein [^10.1128/JVI.00023-19]. After oral administration, its levels in the lungs are much higher than in the plasma and well above its reported EC<sub>50</sub> levels [^10.3390/ph13030051]. Emetine is currently not being studied in any SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials.

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic agent that acts by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in the membranes of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. It has been reported to also inhibit human importin alpha/beta-1 nuclear transport proteins, which viruses hijack to enhance infection by suppressing the host antiviral response [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104760]. Ivermectin weakly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with a reported EC<sub>50</sub> of about 2 μM [^10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104787]. Plasma and lung levels of ivermectin after standard oral dosing have been estimated to be 10-100 fold lower than required to inhibit virus infection in vivo [^10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271][^10.1002/cpt.1889]. A retrospective observational study of 173 hospitalized patients found that treatment with ivermectin 200 ug/kg was associated with reduced mortality compared with 107 contemporaneous patients not receiving ivermectin (15.0% vs. 25.2%; p=0.03), particularly in the subgroup with severe pulmonary disease, which was defined as requiring an FiO2 >=50%, high flow oxygen, or mechanical ventilation (38.8% vs. 87.0%; p=0.001)[^10.1016/j.chest.2020.10.009]. However, two randomized placebo-controlled trials of ivermectin – one of 300 ug/kg per day for five days in 400 patients with symptoms for fewer than seven days and another of 12 mg per day for two days in 112 patients with mild-moderate disease – found no significant virological or clinical improvement associated with the use of ivermectin [^10.1101/2021.01.05.21249310][^10.1001/jama.2021.3071]

Ciclesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid discovered in a high-throughput drug screen to inhibit coronavirus replication in the low μM range [^10.1128/JVI.01648-20][^10.1128/AAC.00819-20][^10.1101/2020.02.25.965582]. Although its mechanism of action is not known, several SARS-CoV-2 passage experiments resulted in nsp3 and nsp4 mutations that were subsequently shown to reduce ciclesonide susceptibility. The mutated regions of nsp3 and nsp4 are thought to be associated with double membrane formation. There is one ongoing randomized phase III placebo-controlled trial of inhaled ciclesonide in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection (NCT04377711).

The sigma-1 endoplasmic reticulum receptor has been identified as a target for antiviral therapy in two large proteomic studies designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 host dependency factors but inhibitors of this receptor have not been evaluated for their inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture [^10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9][^10.1126/science.abe9403]. The signa-1 receptor inhibitor fluvoxamine – an FDA-approved antidepressant – has also been shown to modulate the response to bacterial sepsis in a beneficial manner in a mouse model [^10.1126/scitranslmed.aau5266]. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 152 outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, none of 80 patients receiving fluvoxamine vs. 6 of 72 receiving placebo, experienced clinical deterioration over 15 days (P=0.009). A larger study of fluvoxamine in 1100 patients is currently recruiting participants (NCT 04668950).

## CONCLUSIONS
Antiviral development for SARS-CoV-2 has been disappointing. The most notable therapeutic success has been the development of mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which have been shown to prevent infection in persons with high-risk exposures and to prevent hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19 outpatients. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog previously studied as a treatment for Ebola virus infections, has been found to accelerate clinical improvement in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who did not require high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Convalescent plasma has been to reduce disease severity, but only if it contains high titers of neutralizing antibodies and is administered within the first three days of symptom development. A small number of additional drugs are in phase III clinical trials and many more are in earlier stages of development.

There are several lessons that can be learned from this disappointing progress. The first lesson is that drugs that are ineffective in preclinical studies and lacking a biologically plausible mechanism of action will not be effective in clinical studies. Examples of these drugs included chloroquine analogs, ivermectin, favipiravir, antiretroviral protease inhibitors, and a long tail of other compounds, many of which are not reviewed here. A second lesson is that uncoordinated, poorly designed and underpowered clinical trials are wasteful, often produce misleading results, and arguably unethical [^10.1001/jama.288.3.358]. Many clinical trials of antiviral therapies that were eventually found to be ineffective initially reported positive clinical outcomes, likely indicating bias on the part of researchers or in the publication process.

A third lesson is that no model currently exists for drug development in the setting of a pandemic. Traditional drug-development is an iterative process aimed at maximizing selectivity while improving pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties [^10.1016/j.chom.2020.09.017]. However, in the face of a global public health threat, many researchers anticipated that drugs that were already approved or studied in humans for other indications could be repurposed to treat COVID-19, thus bypassing traditional drug discovery approaches. High-throughput screens identified several compounds that were ideal for further evaluation [^10.1038/s43588-020-00007-6][^10.1038/s41467-020-17189-2][^10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9][^10.1126/science.abe9403][^10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.034][^10.1038/s41586-020-2332-7]. Although some repurposed drugs with promising preclinical data are in phase II clinical trials, the process of creating a clinical trials pathway to investigate existing drugs for new indications has been slow and lacking in transparency. Drug development is expensive and the companies with the financial ability to launch the necessary clinical trials typically lack adequate  economic incentives to investigate drugs that are already approved or to develop new drugs for acute infectious diseases [^10.1038/d41586-020-02884-3].

A fourth lesson is that antiviral therapy for COVID-19 must be administered early in the course of infection. This was largely expected based on the finding that virus loads peak early in infection and that severe COVID-19 disease manifestations arise at a time when virus levels are usually low. Neutralizing mAbs, convalescent plasma, and remdesivir have consistently been most effective when administered early in the course of infection. Antiviral therapy for influenza is also optimal when administered early, however, the requirement for prompt treatment appears to be more strict for SARS-CoV-2 than for influenza [^10.1378/chest.10-2792][^10.1093/jac/dkg007]. The implication of this fourth lesson is that the timely initiation of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy requires the widespread availability of simple, affordable, and self-administered tests for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The final lesson is that surrogate markers predictive of clinical endpoints are needed. Without such markers, clinical trials must be large and expensive. The clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of mAbs and remdesivir required more than 500 patients. However, with the imminent approval of several mAb preparations for SARS-CoV-2-infected persons at high risk of disease progression, will make it unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials in this population in regions where such mAbs are available. This development will necessitate larger clinical trials enrolling low-risk patients or comparing new interventions with mAbs.

In conclusion, the main therapeutic advance during the pandemic has been the development of highly potent neutralizing mAbs for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The administration of remdesivir and convalescent plasma also have a role, but in fewer patients. Several drugs are currently being studied in phase III clinical trials including the nucleoside analog molnupiravir, inhaled interferon, and fluvoxamine. Many more are in earlier stages of clinical development including the nucleoside analog AT-527, the Mpro inhibitor PF-00835231, polyclonal antibody preparations, and the repurposed drugs camostat, apilimod, and PTC-299.

There are also several promising investigational compounds that have not yet entered into clinical trials including single-domain Abs, ACE2 mimics, and fusion inhibitors. Several members of these drug classes are highly potent in vitro and in animal models. Although they block virus entry in a manner similar to neutralizing mAbs, they are likely to be less expensive to produce. In addition, they have the potential for intranasal and/or inhalational administration. Finally, several affordable repurposed drugs have been described that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by plausible biochemical mechanisms but which have not yet undergone sufficient evaluation in appropriately designed clinical trials.
