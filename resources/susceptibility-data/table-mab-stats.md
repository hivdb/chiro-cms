RBM (receptor binding motif) is the part of the receptor binding domain (RBD)
that contains the spike ACE2 binding residues. RBM class 1 mAbs bind epitopes
dominated by ACE2-binding residues and as a result bind solely when the RBD is
in the up/open position. RBM class 2 mAbs have a smaller ACE2-binding footprint
and can often bind the RBD in down/closed position. RBD core mAbs target a
surface accessible part of the RBD that is separate from the RBM. 2The
publications and results include those describing both in vitro selection and
neutralization experiments.
