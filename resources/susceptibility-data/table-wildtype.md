[/table]

This table indicates the list of control viruses used in neutralizing studies
that we have classified as wildtype (WT) variants. As noted several have
mutations (i.e., differences from the Wuhan-Hu reference variant). By
classifying them as wildtype, it becomes possible to aggregate different
studies, even if their control viruses are slightly different.
