For each mAb, the top of the RBD and two side views are depicted using
coordinates from PDB 6M0J. ACE2 binding residues are shown in red; the mAb
epitope defined as those residues within 4.5 angstroms of the RBD is shown in
dark blue; and ACE2 binding residues within the mAb epitope are shown in purple.
Those positions containing mutations that were either selected by the mAb in
vitro (“SEL”), reduced binding in a deep mutational scanning assay (“DMS”),
and/or reduced in vitro neutralizing susceptibility by a median of ≥4-fold in
CoV-RDB (drug resistance; “DR”) are also indicated. The mAb epitopes for BAM
(bamlanivimab), ETE (etesevimab), CAS (casirivimab), IMD (imdevimab), SOT
(sotrovirmab), BEB (Bebtelovimab), CIL (cilgavimab) and TIX (tixagevimab) were
determined from their PDB structures.
