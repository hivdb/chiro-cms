Fold reduced _in vitro_ neutralization susceptibility to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (mAbs) associated with three variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) and six spike amino acid mutations E484K, N501Y, L452R, K417N, N439K, and Y453F. B.1.1.7 contains N501Y plus two S1 N-terminal domain (NTD) deletions, three S1 C-terminal domain (CTD) mutations, and three S2-mutations. B.1.351 contains E484K and N501Y plus four S1 NTD mutations, two receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations, one S1 CTD mutation, and one S2 mutation. P.1 contains E484K and N501Y plus five S1 NTD mutations, one RBD mutation, two S1 CTD mutations, and two S2 mutations. Each of the _in vitro_ susceptibility experiments were performed using pseudovirus assays. Some of the pseudovirus assays performed with single amino acid mutations contained D614G while others did not. D614G has been reported to slightly increase neutralization susceptibility. The Y-axis indicates the log-fold reduction in susceptibility. Data are displayed for mAbs in advanced clinical trials and several additional prototypical mAbs with high-resolution 3-D structures and defined mechanisms of mAb-RBD binding.

- Fold reduced _in vitro_ neutralization susceptibility to plasma from previously infected and vaccinated persons associated with variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.429/B.1.427), and two spike amino acid mutations E484K and N501Y.

- The Y-axis indicates the number of plasma samples tested.
- “\*”: The study is using authentic virus assay.
