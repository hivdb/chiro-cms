COVA1-16 cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1. It competes with ACE2 indirectly via steric hindrance. It binds to RBD in the up configuration, likely bivalently. COVA2-04 and COVA2-39 approach RBD from different angles. COVA2-04 contacts more ACE2-binding residues than COVA2-39 (16 vs. 11 residues). COVA2-15 appears to bind ACE2 in its up and down configuration.

    This panel of neutralizing mAbs was derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent memory B cells that recognize trimeric spike or its RBD. BD-368-2 is an ACE2-competing mAb that can occupy all three RBDs simultaneously regardless of its configuration. It also does not compete with the ACE2-competing mAbs encoded by VH3-53/66. BD-604, BD-629, and BD-236 are ACE2-competing mAbs that bind RBD in its up configuration. BD-23 is an ACE2-competing mAb that binds RBD in its down configuration. BD-368-2 reduced weight loss and virus levels in a mouse treatment and prevention model.

  description: |-
    The REGN panel of neutralizing mAbs was derived primarily from VelocImmune mice immunized with trimeric spike boosted with RBD. REGN10933 and REGN10987 are ACE2-competing mAbs that bind to non-overlapping RBD epitopes. They have been been shown to elicit ADCC and ADCP in vitro. This pair of mAbs reduces virus levels and lung pathology in rhesus macaque treatment and prevention models. The combination has demonstrated preliminary virological efficacy in a phase II trial of outpatients. A phase III trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.

It has been shown to reduce virus levels and possibly hospitalizations in a phase II trial. A phase III trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy. It is also being studied in combination with LY-CoV016 which appears to be the same mAb as CB6 and JS016. LY-CoV555 received FDA emergence use authorization on November 9, 2020.

  description: |-
    S2M11 and S2E12 are ACE-2 competing neutralizing mAbs. S2M11 stabilizes the closed conformation of the spike trimer by binding two neighboring RBDs in their down configurations. S2E12 binds RBD only in its up position. S2M11 (but not S2E12) promote ADCC and ADCP activity. Both S2M11 and S2E12 inhibit virus replication when administered propylactically at low doses to hamsters.
