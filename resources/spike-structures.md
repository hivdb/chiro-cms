![Trimeric Spike Side View](spike-structures/fig1.png#!width=35rem)

**[Figure 1](#fig1). SARS-CoV-2 Trimeric Spike (side view and top view)**. Each color represents one chain in the trimer. The RBD in the blue and magenta chains is in the down configuration while the RBD in the green chain is in the up configuration. (PDB: [6VXX])

![Up/Down Configurations](spike-structures/fig2.png#!width=70rem)

**[Figure 2](#fig2). Trimeric spike structures illustrating RBD up and down configurations**. The structures on the left capture one of three chains having RBD in an up configuration (red) whereas the structures on the right capture show all three chains having RBD in the down configuration. In both sets of structures, the three RBDs are colored red, blue, and yellow. (PDB: [6VXX] \[left two\], [6VYB] \[right two\])

![S1 vs. S2 Trimer](spike-structures/fig4.png#!width=20rem)

**[Figure 4](#fig4). Spike S1 and S2 subunits**. The spike protein processed by host proteases to generate two functional subunits, designated S1 and S2. S1 (shown in blue), which forms the apex of the trimer, is responsible for attachment to the ACE2 receptor. S2 (shown in pink) is responsible for fusion to the cell membrane. (PDB: [6VSB])

![S1 Specifics Trimer With RBM Side View](spike-structures/fig5.png#!width=70rem)

**[Figure 5](#fig5). S1 domains**. The four S1 domains – N terminal domain (NTD; aka S1A; cyan), receptor binding domain (RBD; aka S1B; green),  SD1 (aka S1C; red), SD2 (aka S1D; purple) -- of one S1 chain are shown within the context of the spike trimer. The RBD contains a subdomain at its apex referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM). The RBM shown in yellow contains the residues that bind to cellular ACE2 receptors. (PDB: [6VSB])

![Antibody Core Binding Sites](spike-structures/fig6.png#!width=70rem)

**[Figure 6](#fig6). RBD core antibody sites**. CR3022 and S309 are non-ACE2 competing antibodies that bind nonoverlapping RBD core epitopes. EY6A is a non-ACE2-competing antibody that overlaps with CR3022 (PDB: [6M0J]). The bottom row shows the RBD rotated 180 degrees.

![Antibody RBM Binding Sites Group 1](spike-structures/fig7.png#!width=80rem)

**[Figure 7](#fig7). RBD RBM antibody sites**. P2-2F6, BD23, and 2-4 are ACE2 competing mAbs that bind to overlapping residues. H11-H4 and H11-D4 are nanobodies that bind to the same region. Nearly all of the residues within these antibodies’ epitopes are between positions 449, 484, 490, and 492-494. (PDB: [6M0J])

![Antibody RBM Binding Sites Group 2](spike-structures/fig8.png#!width=90rem)

**[Figure 8](#fig8). RBD RBM antibody sites**. B38, CB6, CC12.1, CC12.3, CV30, and C105 are ACE2 competing antibodies that bind to RBD RBM epitopes. These six antibodies mainly overlap around residues 403, 405, 417, 420, 455-459, 473-476, 486-487, 501, and 505. They are all encoded by the same variable heavy chain gene VH53. (PDB: [6M0J])
