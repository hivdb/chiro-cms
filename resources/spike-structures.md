![Trimeric spike structures illustrating receptor binding domain (RBD) up (open; ACE2 accessible) and down (closed) configurations](spike-structures/fig2.png#!width=70rem)

**[Figure 2](#fig2). Trimeric spike structures illustrating receptor binding domain (RBD) up (open; ACE2 accessible) and down (closed) configurations**. The structures on the left capture one of three chains having RBD in an up configuration (red) whereas the structures on the right capture show all three chains having RBD in the down configuration. In both sets of structures, the three RBDs are colored red, blue, and yellow whereas the individual spike protomers are in cyan, green, and magenta. (PDB: [6VXX] \[left two\], [6VYB] \[right two\])

**[Figure 3](#fig3). Spike RBD bound to ACE-2**. One of the three spike receptor binding domains (RBD) bound to the human ACE2 protein. A structure of the RBD bound to ACE2 (PDB 6M0J) superimposed onto the spike trimer. (PDB [6VSB])

![Spike S1 and S2 subunits](spike-structures/fig4.png#!width=20rem)

**[Figure 4](#fig4). Spike S1 and S2 subunits**. The spike protein is processed by host proteases to generate two functional subunits, designated S1 (shown in blue) and S2 (shown in pink). S1, which forms the apex of the trimer, is responsible for attachment to the ACE2 receptor. S2 is responsible for fusion to the cell membrane. (PDB: [6VSB])

![S1 domains](spike-structures/fig5.png#!width=70rem)

**[Figure 5](#fig5). S1 domains**. The four S1 domains â€“ N terminal domain (NTD; aka S1A; cyan), receptor binding domain (RBD; aka S1B; green), SD1 (aka S1C; red), SD2 (aka S1D; purple) -- of one S1 chain are shown within the context of the spike trimer. The RBD contains a subdomain at its apex referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM). The RBM shown in yellow contains the residues that bind to ACE2. (PDB: [6VSB])

![RBD core mAb epitopes](spike-structures/fig6.png#!width=60rem)

**[Figure 6](#fig6). RBD core mAb epitopes**. CR3022 and S309 are non-ACE2 competing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that bind non-overlapping receptor binding domain (RBD) core epitopes. The core is defined as the part of the RBD that does not contain the receptor binding motif (RBM). EY6A is a non-ACE2-competing mAb that overlaps with CR3022 (PDB: [6M0J]). The bottom row shows the RBD rotated 180 degrees. The ACE2 binding residues are shown in green.

![RBD RBM antibody sites group 1](spike-structures/fig7.png#!width=90rem)

**[Figure 7](#fig7). RBD RBM antibody sites**. B38, CB6, CC12.1, CC12.3, CV30, and C105 are ACE2 competing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to a high proportion of ACE2-binding residues. Each mAb is encoded by the same variable heavy chain gene IGHV3-53. The bottom row shows the RBD rotated 180 degrees. The ACE2 binding residues are shown in green.

![RBD RBM antibody sites group 2](spike-structures/fig8.png#!width=80rem)

**[Figure 8](#fig8). RBD RBM antibody sites**. P2-2F6, BD23, and 2-4 are ACE2 competing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to overlapping residues. H11-H4 and H11-D4 are nanobodies that bind to the same region. These mAbs generally bind a lower proportion of ACE2-binding residues (compared with those in Figure 7) and are not encoded by IGHV3-53. The bottom row shows the RBD rotated 180 degrees. The ACE2 binding residues are shown in green.
