Sierra-SARS2 NGS program accepts user-submitted full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome
codon frequency tables (CodFreq Files). CodFreq Files are tab- or
comma-delimited text files containing the following 5 columns:

- Gene (nsp1, nsp2, PLpro, nsp4, 3CLpro, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, RdRP,
nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, or
ORF10);
- Amino acid position;
- Number of reads for the position (coverage);
- Sequenced codon;
- Number of reads containing the codon.

Below are two example CodFreq files, which can be viewed in your browser by
clicking on them. These files can also be downloaded and viewed in Microsoft
Excel. These same two files can be uploaded to Sierra-SARS2 NGS program by
clicking on the Load Example Data link on the Input sequence reads form.
