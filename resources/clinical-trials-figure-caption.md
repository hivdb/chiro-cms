Distribution of targets (Figure A) and the most commonly studied compounds
(Figure B) for published, ongoing, and planned antiviral clinical trials.
The number above each bar indicates the total number of patients involved
in all related trials. Although chloroquine analogs are considered to act primarily
through the inhibition of virus endosomal trafficking, they are separated out
from other endosomal trafficking inhibitors in Figure A. Figure B shows those
compounds included in three or more trials.
