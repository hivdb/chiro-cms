mab-desc_Bamlanivimab: |-
  **Bamlanivimab** (aka LY-CoV555; LY3819253) is an ACE2-competing mAb that
  binds RBD in the up and down configurations. It reduces upper airway and
  lower airway virus levels in rhesus macaques. It has been shown to reduce
  virus levels and possibly hospitalizations in a phase II trial. A phase III
  trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.
  It is also being studied in combination with Etesevimab which appears to be
  the same mAb as LY-CoV016, CB6 and JS016. Bamlanivimab received FDA emergence
  use authorization (EUA) on November 9, 2020. The EUA was revoked on April 19,
  2021, although the combination EUA of Bamlanivimab+Etesevimab is still
  available.

  Bamlanivimab is developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly.
mab-desc_Etesevimab: |-
  **Etesevimab** (aka CB6, JS016, LY-CoV016, LY3832479) is an ACE2-competing
  neutralizing mAb derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent memory B cells. It has
  been shown to reduice virus levels and lung pathology when administered 1 day
  before or after infection of rhesus macaques. Its Fc receptor has been
  mutated (LALA) to prolong its half-life. It is being evaluated as monotherapy
  in a phase I trial and in combination with Bamlanivimab in a phase II trial.

  Etesevimab is developed by Junshi Biosciences and Institute of Microbiology,
  Chinese Academy of Science (IMCAS). It is licensed to Eli Lilly.

  The REGN panel of neutralizing mAbs was derived primarily from VelocImmune
  mice immunized with trimeric spike boosted with RBD. **Casirivimab**
  (REGN10933) and Imdevimab (REGN10987) are ACE2-competing mAbs that bind to
  non-overlapping RBD epitopes. They have been been shown to elicit ADCC and
  ADCP in vitro. This pair of mAbs reduces virus levels and lung pathology in
  rhesus macaque treatment and prevention models. The combination has
  demonstrated preliminary virological efficacy in a phase II trial of
  outpatients. A phase III trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued
  because of lack of efficacy. This pair of mAbs is granted an emergence use
  authorization (EUA) by the FDA on November 20, 2020.

  Casirivimab is developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

mab-desc_Sotrovimab: |-
  S309 is derived from SARS-CoV-1 convalescent memory B cells that recognize
  SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike. It is a non-ACE2-competing mAb that binds to the
  RBD core region and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV-1. It binds to RBD in its up
  and down configurations and it binds to a unique proteoglycan epitope at
  N343. It has been shown to elicit ADCC and ADCP in vitro and it has undergone
  Fc modifications to prolong its half-life. **Sotrovimab** (aka VIR-7831,
  GSK4182136) is developed based on S309, and is being studied in a phase II
  trial. Sotrovimab is granted an emergence use authorization (EUA) by the FDA
