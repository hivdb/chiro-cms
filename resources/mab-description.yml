mab-desc_Bamlanivimab: |-
  **Bamlanivimab** (aka LY-CoV555; LY3819253) is an ACE2-competing mAb that
  binds RBD in the up and down configurations. It reduces upper airway and
  lower airway virus levels in rhesus macaques. It has been shown to reduce
  virus levels and possibly hospitalizations in a phase II trial. A phase III
  trial in hospitalized patients was discontinued because of lack of efficacy.
  It is also being studied in combination with Etesevimab which appears to be
  the same mAb as LY-CoV016, CB6 and JS016. Bamlanivimab received FDA emergence
  use authorization (EUA) on November 9, 2020. The EUA was revoked on April 19,
  2021, although the combination EUA of Bamlanivimab+Etesevimab is still
  available.

  before or after infection of rhesus macaques. Its Fc receptor has been
  mutated (LALA) to prolong its half-life. It is being evaluated as monotherapy
  in a phase I trial and in combination with Bamlanivimab in a phase II trial.
