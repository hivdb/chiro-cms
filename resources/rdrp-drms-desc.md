This table lists SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor
resistance mutations. The RdRP resistance mutations shown met one or more of the
following criteria: (1) having a ≥2.5-fold reduction in susceptibility to an
RdRP inhibitor; (2) reported to be selected in vitro by an RdRP inhibitor in two
or more studies; and/or (3) selected in vivo in two or more patients receiving
an RdRP inhibitor.

A
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#146aa8;color:white;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">dark blue cell</span>
indicates a median ≥10-fold reduction in susceptibility; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#7fcbee;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">light blue cell</span>
indicates a median 5-10-fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#e6f5fc;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">very light cell</span>
cell indicates a median 2.5-5-fold reduction; a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:white;border:1px solid black;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">white cell</span>
indicates a median <2.5-fold reduction; and a
<span style="border-radius:.3rem;background-color:#f0f0f0;border:1px solid #aaa;display:inline-block;padding:0 .4rem;">gray cell</span>
indicates the absence of susceptibility data. Mutations with a yellow background
represent the consensus for one or more variants of concern or interest.

The numbers in the “in patient” column indicate the numbers of times the
mutation was selected in vivo in a patient receiving an RdRP inhibitor. The
numbers in the “in vitro” column indicate the number of studies the mutation was
reported to be selected during passage in the presence of an RdRP inhibitor.

The proportions in the "prevalence" column show the mutation prevalence reported
by the Kosakovsky Pond laboratory as of June 2022. Proportions ≥ 1/10,000 are
colored in yellow. A CSV/Excel file is available for downloading which includes
the exact values of median folds.
