  Analysis of routinely available genomic data in Kent, England was undertaken as part of an epidemiological investigation to investigate increasing incidence on 8 December 2020. Although only 4% (255/6130) of Kent cases had available genomes through COGUK sequencing, a large phylogenetic cluster of 117 genomically similar cases over the week 10-18 November 2020 was identified.

  The Kent cluster, when examined in the national phylogeny, is part of a larger cluster (962 genomes at the time of analysis on 8 December 2020). This cluster is phylogenetically very distinct from the rest of the UK dataset. These cases were concentrated in Kent and NE London, with limited spread into the rest of London, Anglia and Essex.

  Of the 962 cases in the cluster, data was available for 915 individuals; most specimen dates were in November (828/915) followed by October (79/915), with a small number of cases in September (4/915). Distribution of cases by patient sex is similar (51% female, 49% male). By age, just under 90% of individuals are aged <60 years; work is being undertaken to compare this age distribution to relevant comparators. Six of the 915 cases are deceased.
