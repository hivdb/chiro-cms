  Here, we report on the increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A.27 in Germany during the first months of 2021. Genomic surveillance at the Public Health Institute in Germany identified 710 A.27 genomes as of May 02nd, 2021, with a vast majority identified in laboratories from a single German state (Baden-Wuerttemberg, n=572; 80.5%). Baden-Wuerttemberg is located near the border with France, from where to date most A.27 sequences were submitted to GISAID. The first appearance of this lineage based on sequencing in a laboratory in Baden-Wuerttemberg can be dated to early January. From then on, the relative abundance of A.27 increased until the end of February but has since declined - meanwhile, the abundance of B.1.1.7 increased in the region. The A.27 lineage shows a mutational pattern typical of VOIs/VOCs, including an accumulation of amino acid substitutions in spike. Among those, L18F, L452R and N501Y are located in the N-terminal- (NTD) or receptor binding domain (RBD) epitope regions and have been suggested to result in immune escape and higher transmissibility. In addition, A.27 does not show the D614G mutation typical for all VOIs/VOCs from the B lineage. Overall, it seems sensible to further monitor the spread of A.27 nationally and internationally, although the observed trend in Baden-Wuerttemberg suggests that it will also be outcompeted by B.1.1.7.
