  Here we investigated whether Omicron escapes antibody neutralization elicited by the Pfizer
  BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and whether the virus still requires binding to the ACE2 receptor to infect
  cells. We used an early passage of isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus isolated in
  South Africa. We used a human lung cell line clone (H1299-ACE2) engineered to express the ACE2
  receptor (2) to both isolate the virus and test neutralization. We also tested growth in the parental
  H1299 which do not overexpress ACE2 and are not appreciably infectable with SARS-CoV-2.
  The H1299-ACE2 cells were similar to Vero-E6 in titer dependent focus formation, but were
  considerably more sensitive.
