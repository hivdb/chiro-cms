  ([Full report](https://virological.org/t/685))
  We report a novel sublineage of B.1.1.1 (now C.37) that presents a deletion in the ORF1a gene (Δ3675-3677), also present in variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. It displays a novel deletion and multiple nonsynonymous mutations in the Spike gene (Δ246-252, G75V, T76I, L452Q, F490S, T859N). Initially reported in Lima, Peru, in late December, it now accounts for 50 of 105 (47.6%) genomes in Lima between January 1 and March 18. Further RT-qPCR screening for VOCs suggests that it is widespread in other regions of Peru. It is also expanding in Chile and has been reported in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US.
