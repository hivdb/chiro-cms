variant-desc_Alpha: |-
  **Alpha variant** is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
  One of several variants of concern, the variant is estimated to be 40–80%
  more transmissible than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (with most estimates
  occupying the middle to higher end of this range). It was first detected in
  November 2020 from a sample taken in September in the United Kingdom, and
  began to spread quickly by mid-December, around the same time as infections
  surged. This increase is thought to be at least partly because of one or more
  mutations in the virus' spike protein.  The variant is also notable for
  having more mutations than normally seen.  (©[Wikipedia][Wikipedia], CC BY-SA

  **Beta variant** is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
  One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed to be of particular importance,
  it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area of the
  Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October 2020, which was reported by
  the country's health department on 18 December 2020. Phylogeographic analysis

variant-desc_Gamma: |-
  **Gamma variant** is one of the variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
  COVID-19. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been named lineage P.1 and has 17
  amino acid substitutions, ten of which are in its spike protein, including
  these three designated to be of particular concern: N501Y, E484K and K417T.
  This variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by the National Institute of
  Infectious Diseases (NIID) of Japan, on 6 January 2021 in four people who had
  arrived in Tokyo having visited Amazonas, Brazil, four days earlier. It was
  subsequently declared to be in circulation in Brazil.  Under the simplified
  naming scheme proposed by the World Health Organization, P.1 has been labeled
  Gamma variant, and is currently considered a variant of concern.

variant-desc_Iota: |-
  **Iota variant** is one of the variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
  COVID-19. It was first detected in New York City in November 2020. The variant
  has appeared with two notable mutations: the E484K spike mutation, which may
  help the virus evade antibodies, and the S477N mutation, which may help the
  virus bind more tightly to human cells.

  By February 2021, it had spread rapidly in the New York region and accounted
  for about one in four viral sequences. By 11 April 2021, the variant had been
  detected in at least 48 U.S. states and 18 countries.

  World Health Organization (WHO) named it Lambda variant and designated it as
  a variant of interest. It has spread to at least 30 countries around the
  world and is known to be more resistant to neutralizing antibodies compared
  to other strains. There is evidence that suggests the Lambda variant is both
  more infectious and resistant to vaccines than the Alpha and/or Gamma
  variant. (©[Wikipedia][Wikipedia], CC BY-SA 3.0)
