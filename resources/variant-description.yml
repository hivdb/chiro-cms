variant-desc_Alpha: |-
  The **Alpha variant**, also known as lineage B.1.1.7, is a variant of
  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One of several variants of
  concern, the variant is estimated to be 40–80% more transmissible than the
  wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (with most estimates occupying the middle to higher end
  of this range). It was first detected in November 2020 from a sample taken in
  September in the United Kingdom, and began to spread quickly by mid-December,
  around the same time as infections surged. This increase is thought to be at
  least partly because of one or more mutations in the virus' spike protein.
  The variant is also notable for having more mutations than normally seen.

  E484K mutation occurs in a small number of Alpha genomes, which was named as
  "VOC-202102/02" by the Public Health England.

  **Beta variant**, also known as lineage B.1.351, is a variant of SARS-CoV-2,
  the virus that causes COVID-19. One of several SARS-CoV-2 variants believed
  to be of particular importance, it was first detected in the Nelson Mandela
  Bay metropolitan area of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa in October
  2020, which was reported by the country's health department on 18 December
  2020. Phylogeographic analysis suggests this variant emerged in the Nelson
  Mandela Bay area in July or August 2020. (©[Wikipedia][Wikipedia], CC BY-SA

variant-desc_Gamma: |-
  **Gamma variant**, also known as lineage P.1, is one of the variants of
  SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been
  named lineage P.1 and has 17 amino acid substitutions, ten of which are in its
  spike protein, including these three designated to be of particular concern:
  N501Y, E484K and K417T. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by the
  National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) of Japan, on 6 January 2021
  in four people who had arrived in Tokyo having visited Amazonas, Brazil, four
  days earlier. It was subsequently declared to be in circulation in Brazil.
  Under the simplified naming scheme proposed by the World Health Organization,
  P.1 has been labeled Gamma variant, and is currently considered a variant of
  concern. (©[Wikipedia][Wikipedia], CC BY-SA 3.0)

  The **Delta variant** is a new strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
  COVID-19. It was first detected in India in late 2020. The Delta variant was
  named on 31 May 2021 and had spread to over 163 countries by 24 August 2021.
  The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the Delta variant is
  becoming the dominant strain globally. (©[Wikipedia][Wikipedia], CC BY-SA
