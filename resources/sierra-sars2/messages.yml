  SARS-CoV-2 Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  Mutations of each SARS-CoV-2 gene, Spike, RdRP, nsp1-10 (include PLpro and
  3CLpro), nsp13-16, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N and ORF10, can be
  entered using the text box. To use the text box, type or paste mutations
  separated by one or more spaces. The mutation should start with its gene's
  name and a colon followed. For Spike protein, the gene's name and the colon
  is optional. The reference wildtype and separating commas are optional. If
  there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a position, write both
  amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional). Insertions should be
  indicated by “ins” and deletions by “del”.

  Mutation format examples:

  - a Spike mutation: 452R, N501Y
  - a pure mutation: S:E484K, RdRP:323L
  - a mixture mutation: S:614DG
  - a deletion: nsp6:S106del
  - an insertion: nsp6:34ins

  SARS-CoV-2 Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is
  entered.  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple
  sequences are entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded
  using the File Upload option. The upper limit is currently 100 sequences
  containing ~30000 nucleotides per sequence.

  SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Reads of each SARS-CoV-2 gene, Spike, RdRP, nsp1-10
  (include PLpro and 3CLpro), nsp13-16, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N and
  ORF10, can be submittted in the form of [codon frequency tables (CodFreq
  files)][codfreq] or [AAVF files][aavf] described by the [Winnipeg
  Consensus][winnipeg-paper].
