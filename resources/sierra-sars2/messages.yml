  SARS-CoV-2 Mutations Analysis Report

pattern-analysis-form-desc: |-
  Mutations of each SARS-CoV-2 gene, Spike, RdRP, nsp1-10 (include PLpro and
  3CLpro), nsp13-16, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N and ORF10, can be
  entered using the text box. To use the text box, type or paste mutations
  separated by one or more spaces. The mutation should start with its gene's
  name and a colon followed. For Spike protein, the gene's name and the colon
  is optional. The reference wildtype and separating commas are optional. If
  there is a mixture of more than one amino acid at a position, write both
  amino amino acids (an intervening slash is optional). Insertions should be
  indicated by “ins” and deletions by “del”.

  Mutation format examples:

  - a Spike mutation: 452R, N501Y
  - a pure mutation: S:E484K, RdRP:323L
  - a mixture mutation: S:614DG
  - a deletion: nsp6:S106del
  - an insertion: nsp6:34ins

  SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Analysis Report

sequence-analysis-form-desc: |-
  SARS-CoV-2 Sequences can be entered as plain text if just one sequence is
  entered.  Sequences must be entered using the FASTA format if multiple
  sequences are entered. Sequences can be pasted in the text box or uploaded
  using the File Upload option. The upper limit is currently 100 sequences
  containing ~30000 nucleotides per sequence.

  SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Reads (NGS) Analysis Report

seqreads-analysis-form-desc: |-
  SARS-CoV-2 Sequence Reads of each SARS-CoV-2 gene, Spike, RdRP, nsp1-10
  (include PLpro and 3CLpro), nsp13-16, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N and
  ORF10, can be submittted in the form of [codon frequency tables (CodFreq
  files)](/page/codfreq/).

  We provide a pipeline for directly aligning FASTQ files and generating
  CodFreq tables from the MINIMAP2 alignments. To use this pipeline, just add
  the .fastq or .fastq.gz files to the below input form. By clicking the "Start
  process" button, the program will automatically start the FASTQ pipeline,
  upload your FASTQ files to our server. Once the pipeline is finished, buttons
  for downloading the CodFreq tables or directly running the analysis will
  appear.

  For submitted FASTQ files, please note that these files will be stored for
  two weeks for quality control purposes in the event that questions arise
  regarding the manner in which the codon frequency file is produced.

  SARS-CoV-2 NGS Pipeline **converts FASTQ files into codon frequency tables
  (CodFreq files)**. The pipeline first aligns FASTQ files using MINIMAP2. It
  then extracts codon frequency tables from the output SAM files.

  Example of a CodFreq file. Two additional columns "aminoAcid" and "percent"
  are added to help understanding:
