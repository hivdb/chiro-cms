The Coronavirus Antiviral Research Database is designed to expedite the development of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy by helping scientists, clinical investigators, public health officials, and funding agencies prioritize the most promising compounds and repurposed drugs for further development.

The Database promotes uniform reporting of experimental results to facilitate comparisons between different candidate antiviral compounds, identifies gaps in coronavirus antiviral drug development, and provides an objective synthesis of published antiviral research. 

The Database contains data from in vitro experiments and animal model and clinical studies. It contains lookup explanatory tables for drugs, investigational compounds, molecular targets of therapy, virus strains, cell lines, animal models, and pharmacokinetic data. The drugs and investigational compounds are classified into 13 main compound classes based on their mechanism of action.
