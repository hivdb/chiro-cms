Stanford Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database houses comprehensively
curated published data on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants to
monoclonal antibodies and the plasma from previously infected and vaccinated
persons. It also records the spike mutations that are selected by monoclonal
antibodies and that emerge in persons experiencing prolonged infection.
